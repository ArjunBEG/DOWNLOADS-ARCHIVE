<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  Extended Object Literals simplify object creation and composition by reducing the required amount
  of typing with some syntactic sugar.
</p>
<p>
  With this, object literals are now syntactically similar to ES6â€™s new class syntax and have less
  duplication in common use-cases like constructor function.
