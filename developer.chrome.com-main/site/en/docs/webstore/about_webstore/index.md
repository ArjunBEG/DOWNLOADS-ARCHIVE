The [Chrome Web Store][1] lets you publish apps and games—either free or paid—where Google Chrome
users can easily find them. Whenever Chrome users create a new window or tab, they see the apps
they've installed, along with a store icon that reminds them to find more apps.

If you already have a web app, you can create a metadata file and then publish your app in the store
within minutes. Or you can create and publish an app that's specialized for Chrome, such as an
extension for Chrome or a web app that's been modified to be downloaded and run on the user's
computer.

Your app can be free, or you can charge for it using either Chrome Web Store Payments or your own
custom payment system. A [Licensing API][2] lets you check whether the current user has paid for
your app with Chrome Web Store Payments.

To upload and publish apps, use the [Chrome Developer Dashboard][3].

## Why should I use the Chrome Web Store?

Publishing your app in the Chrome Web Store lets you reach more people. You can also earn revenue or
build Chrome-specific features into your app.

## How do I start?
