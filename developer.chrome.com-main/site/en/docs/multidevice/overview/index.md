description: An overview of how you can run web content on different devices.
---

Google provides three ways to run web content on tablets, smartphones, and other devices:

- Using Chrome Mobile for devices running Android 4.0 and later, and iOS.
- With the default Android browser, for devices running versions of Android earlier than 4.0 (Ice
  Cream Sandwich).
- Within a [WebView][1] in a native Android application.

The Google Chrome Mobile browser is based on the same code used by Chrome for Desktop. See the
following pages:

- [Chrome for Android][2]

## Getting started

- Visit [Google Play][3] to install Chrome for Android or [AppStore][4] for Chrome for iOS.

  debugging works with Chrome for Android and the Chrome WebView.
