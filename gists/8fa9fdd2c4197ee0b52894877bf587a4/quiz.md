A top-level `App` component returns `<Button />` from its `render()` method.

1. What is the relationship between `<Button />` and `this` in that `Button`â€™s `render()`?

2. Does rendering `<Button><Icon /></Button>` guarantee that an `Icon` mounts?

3. Can the `App` change anything in the `Button` output? What and how?
