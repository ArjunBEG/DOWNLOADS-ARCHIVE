// my brain decided to ask the question: yknow, i want you to think about the y combinator --
// like, what is it. like what the fuck girl, cmon, you have a comp sci degree, you should know this, and understand it and shit

// and so i was like fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine gosh, lets see if typescript can handle the typing, and play around with it

// so i looked up a javascript implementation, and played with the type defintion until it
// matched up and then i was like oh: thats what the type definition of the functions in it are.
// i get it now. that's pretty cool. the main interesting thing is a the inner function that takes itself
// and returns the function initially passed to the outer function. neato.

// yay!

//                               |           and returns a function with the same
//                               |           signature as the inner function of `Y`
//                               this function takes itself

// it's doing great, but it's not that great yet

// of the y combinator example i was working from, i removed types that typescript could infer and determined the types
// for the abstractions too
