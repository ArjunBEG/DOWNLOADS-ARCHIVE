This is a very interesting effort to create a living cell from non-living
chemical components.

I'm interested in thinking about a digital analog of this project.  NASA defines
life as “a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.” If
you replace "chemical" with "digital", would such a thing be possible?
