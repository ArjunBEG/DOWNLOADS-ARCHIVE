Hey there, @github/services team! 

You all are shipping and delivering incredible work, and with your busy schedules thought it'd provide a bit of context on [Services #288](https://github.com/github/services/pull/288).
 
@jroll, aka Awesome Jessica, continues her amazing work enhancing the customer experience by coordinating  engagements, managing initial discussions, and coordinating delivery. The checklist update in Pull Request [#288](https://github.com/github/services/pull/288) helps to distinguish the tasks Jessica does so well, and clarifies where [Services Sales Engineering (SSE)](https://githubber.com/category/crafts/field-services) will be engaged in on-going technical communications and project management.
 
As SSE, I'll be responsible for communicating consistent technical details, setting pre-engagement expectations, drafting SOWs, and serving as point-of-contact throughout an engagement's delivery. 

By taking on these responsibilities, it's my goal to mitigate the noise of customer communications and permit team members more time to focus on engagement preparations and readiness.

We're an amazing team, and as we grow both in scale and capacity, look forward to seeing each of our role specialities support one another in making GitHub and Services even more of a success.
