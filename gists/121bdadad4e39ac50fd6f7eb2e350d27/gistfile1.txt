DOM API

https://github.com/microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator/pull/802

Fixes: 
 - Can they show code which uses this API as shown?
 - Does the code appear to be low impact?
   - For a high impact change, is the value worth it - this should probably only for nullability or number to number | string 
 - Can we add a script to run a bot with latest lib DTS over on the TypeScript side - ask wes for feasibility for user tests

Adding:
  - Should show in browser-compat-data
  - Multiple implementations (e.g. two of Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
  - Does it show as https://www.w3.org/TR/
  - If it's a huge change, we should consider if it'll be used by many - because it slows people's compiles
  - Consider a global string union which has common values like "left" | "right" - it could get type aliased to something globally

  
  
  Ready? 
   - Is it in IDL? (You might have to manually look up in WHATWG) - needs an explaination if there isn't an IDL

Removing: 

 - When was the feature deprecated? 
 - 2 year deprecation  for vendor prefixes
 - Can we find any up-to-date info on the property/field
 - Does it show up in https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data
 - Still in old versions
