Since 2013 I've worked entirely in the open, lowering the barriers to different developer ecosystems as one of the most active users on GitHub. 

I've helped big OSS projects with design, project management and occasionally code.

I'm currently exploring a YouTube video series and am interested in where GitHub Sponsors goes.
