Background blur calculator (bokeh number)
=========================================

Based on "Bokeh calculator" by syamastro - http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~syam/Photo/bokeh.html

When result is less than one, there is no bokeh effect (the background is completely sharp); bokeh becomes obvious at 10 and is huge when result is larger than 100 (total background blur).
