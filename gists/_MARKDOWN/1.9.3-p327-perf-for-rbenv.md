# ruby-1.9.3-p327 cumulative performance patch for rbenv

This installs a patched ruby 1.9.3-p327 with various performance improvements and a backported COW-friendly GC, all [courtesy of funny-falcon](https://gist.github.com/4136373).

### Requirements

* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/)
* [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/)
* apple-gcc42 for XCode > 4.2

~~You will also need a C Compiler. If you're on Linux, you probably already have one or know how to install one. On OS X, you should install XCode, and `brew install autoconf` using [homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew).~~

On MacOS 10.8 with Command Line Tools installed you'll have to install older version of `gcc`:

```
brew update
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install apple-gcc42
```


### Ok, let's do this!

```
export VERSION=1.9.3-p327
curl https://gist.github.com/jafrog/6988331/raw/dfb790cacbb56d4cf85cc890445471e491d461ef/2-$VERSION-patched > /tmp/$VERSION-perf
env CC=/usr/local/Cellar/apple-gcc42/4.2.1-5666.3/bin/gcc-4.2 rbenv install /tmp/$VERSION-perf
```

### BONUS!

Putting the following in your shell config (eg. `~/.bash_profile`) will make Rails even faster, but will increase its memory footprint. For most applications, this will probably work well for you:

    export RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=60000000
    export RUBY_FREE_MIN=200000

If you have a particularly large rails app (say, >100k lines), this seems to improve it even more:

    export RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=1000000000
    export RUBY_FREE_MIN=500000
    export RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS=40000

### More BONUS!

If you're feeling adventurous, you can set some additional compile flags before you run the command above. These may cause the build to fail. If so, you can try again without the `march` flag, and it'll probably work. **This generally makes my ruby ~1.5% faster**. See http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags/Intel for more guidance. I had to change it to `-march=core2` on my Macbook Air 2011/11".

    export CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"

This has to be run *BEFORE* you compile ruby.
