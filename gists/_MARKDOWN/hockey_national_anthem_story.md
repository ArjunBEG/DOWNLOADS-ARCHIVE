This past week a bunch of us from InVision were at a minor league hockey game in Austin.

I was waiting in line at one of the restaurants, just outside the arena entrance. I got to the front of the line, and was about to order, when the national anthem could be heard from inside the arena.

I look up from the menu, and notice that the entire staff is standing still, smiling, with their hands over their hearts. Realizing that the national anthem is being played, I do the same.

My coworker (from Europe) is to my immediate right, in front of another cash register, and he's also begun looking up from his menu.

> Coworker: "Hmm, I think I would like to order the…"

He looks around, seeing everyone (restaurant staff, other customers, etc) standing still. Not knowing what's going on, he looks over at me for an explanation. Realizing I'm doing the same thing, he mouths to me:

> Coworker: "What… is… happening!?"

It was hilarious, as if he had entered the Twilight Zone, and was the only one unaffected without his hand over his heart.
