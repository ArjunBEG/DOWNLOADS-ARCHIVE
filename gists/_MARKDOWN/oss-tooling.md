OSS Tracker is an application that collects information about a Github organization and aggregates the data across all projects within that organization into a single user interface to be used by various roles within the owning organization.

For the community manager, all repositories are listed and metrics are combined for the organization as a whole. A community manager can also organize projects into functional areas and appoint shepherds of these areas to assign management and engineering leads.

The shepherds of each functional area can not only assign and maintain leads for each project, but also view aggregated metrics for their area.

For individual owners, the OSS tracker gives a daily summary as well as historical information on key repository metrics such as open issues and pull requests, days since last commit, and average time to resolve issues and pull requests.
