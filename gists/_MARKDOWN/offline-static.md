Every year at Mother we have an all-agency ski trip.

This year, we want a responsive site that will work on phones while people are on the slopes.  The cell phone coverage there is shit so offline is necessary.

We basically need a schedule of events, phone numbers, etc.  Nothing serious and nothing super interactive.

However, we are considering a leaderboard of sorts for some activities, but not a dealbreaker if data is eventually consistent.

Nonetheless, background syncing of sorts and adding to home page is a requirement.

Should be relatively straightforward but didn't want to go reinvent the wheel if a boilerplate exists.
