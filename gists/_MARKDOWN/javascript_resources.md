## Libraries

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - The de-facto library for the modern age. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) - Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) - Conventions based MVC framework for HTML5 apps.
- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects.
- [lawnchair](http://brian.io/lawnchair/) - Key/value store adapter for indexdb, localStorage and more
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) - Minimal semantic templating

## Tools
- [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - Javascript Task Runner

## Guides
- [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) - Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
- [Building a Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html) - Extensions allow you to add functionality to Chrome without diving deeply into native code.
