# JavaScript Environment Requirements

React 16 depends on the collection types [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set). If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (eg <IE11), consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application, such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/).

A polyfilled environment for React 16 using core-js to support older browsers might look like:

```js
import 'core-js/es6/map';
import 'core-js/es6/set';

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

React also depends on `requestAnimationFrame` (even in test environments). A simple shim for testing environments would be:

```
global.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback) {
  setTimeout(callback, 0);
};
```
