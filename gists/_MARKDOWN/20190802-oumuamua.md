Interesting podcast about the astronomical outlier object
[ʻOumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua). Harvard Prof of
Astronomy, Avi Loeb explores the idea that the object was a light-sail space
craft sent from another civilization to check out earth.

His arguments seem very well positioned. I had previously assumed these ideas to
be crackpot-y. He presents a theory that can be tested in a couple years when 
[the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope) comes
online.

More recently than this podcast [scientific counter arguments have been made](https://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-have-determined-oumuamua-is-really-truly-not-an-alien-lightsail). But the podcast is 
nevertheless interesting.

Rob Reid is an excellent conversationalist on all sorts of topics. [Check out his
podcast](https://after-on.com/).  I heard of him via [Sean Caroll's
podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/07/15/55-a-conversation-with-rob-reid-on-quantum-mechanics-and-many-worlds/).
