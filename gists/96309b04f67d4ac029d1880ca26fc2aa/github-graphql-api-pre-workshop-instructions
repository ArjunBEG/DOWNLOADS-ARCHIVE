Install Instructions for the MLH Prime GitHub GraphQL API Workshop

1. GraphiQL desktop app (you don't strictly needs this, but it makes tihngs easier)

If you're on a Mac
- If you don't have Brew, install it from here: https://brew.sh/
- if you already have brew run: brew cask install graphiql

If you're on Windows or Linux
- Make sure you have npm installed. (Get node and npm here: https://nodejs.org/en/)
- go to https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app/releases and download the latest release (Source Code (zip))
- unzip it and cd into the folder
- run npm install
- run npm build
- run npm start

If this doesn't work, you can also use the web version: https://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/explorer/
Although in my opinion the web version is slightly worse for understanding the whole process because it's more magical.

2. Github API
- If you don't already have a github account, create one: https://github.com
- Join the Early Access programme: https://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/

3. Get a token
- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate New Token"
- Give your token a name like "Prime API Workshop"
- Select the "repo" and "user" scopes
- Click the green "Generate Token" button
- Keep that token in a safe place for later, we'll need it in the workshop
