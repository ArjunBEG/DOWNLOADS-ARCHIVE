Thanks everyone for participating in the [quiz](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/8fa9fdd2c4197ee0b52894877bf587a4)!  
Many of you have posted correct answers.  

**What we know:**

A top-level `App` component returns `<Button />` from its `render()` method.

**Question:**

>What is the relationship between `<Button />` and `this` in that `Button`’s `render()`?

**Answer:** 

`<Button>` is a React "element".  
If you log it, you will see a plain object like `{ type: Button, props: {} }`.

The element does not represent anything on the screen at that point.  
It is a *description* of what `App` wants to be rendered.

At some point, React will look at that description and think: “Hmm, there was no `Button` here but now there should be. So I’ll create a `Button` instance.”

This `Button` instance created by React is `this` value in the `render()` and lifecycle methods. It’s only useful for calling `setState()` or reading the props and state.

If `App` gets re-rendered and React sees a `<Button />` in its output again, it will think: “Hmm, I already have a `Button` instance exactly at the same spot. Rather than create a new one, I will just update props on the existing one and re-render it.”

Let’s recap.

`<Button />` is an element, a description of what should be rendered. `this` inside the `Button` is the actual instance React created based on that description.

`App` can return a different `<Button />` element every time but as long as its key doesn’t change, and it is still a `<Button />` and not a `<Door />`, React will keep using the same instance. 

**Question:**

>Does rendering `<Button><Icon /></Button>` guarantee that an `Icon` mounts?

It doesn’t. Ultimately it’s always up to the component to decide what to do with its children. For example, the `Button` implementation could completely ignore them and render something else:

```jsx
function Button(props) {
  return <h1>I render whatever I want</h1>
}
```

Interestingly, it could also render `children` multiple times:

```jsx
function Button(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      I like to repeat things.
      {props.children}
      {props.children}
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Ultimately, `children` is not a special prop in any way except for JSX sugar syntax. `<Button><Icon /></Button>` is technically the same as `<Button children={<Icon />} />`, and it’s up to the component how to treat its input props.

**Question:**

>Can the `App` change anything in the `Button` output? What and how?

**Answer:** 

There have been a few fun answers in the [quiz comments](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/8fa9fdd2c4197ee0b52894877bf587a4) so I will direct you to them. Indeed, since JavaScript doesn't provide any guarantees, technically you can hijack `Button` before React gets a chance to render it.

However, normally there is no way for a parent component to control the child output except by two mechanisms: passing props and providing context. You probably already know about props, and I won’t talk about the context because it’s an experimental API and has a few pitfalls. Don’t use context in apps unless [you know its pitfalls well](https://medium.com/@mweststrate/how-to-safely-use-react-context-b7e343eff076).

Of course, if you get a DOM node for the component via refs, you can do anything you want with the DOM nodes of other components, but it will likely mess up React.
