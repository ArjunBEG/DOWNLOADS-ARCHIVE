So I was thinking about how I never respond to recruiter emails,
and how their way of try to appeal to me is a bit lacking:
work on some framework, create a new framework, be a senior dev/cto, etc.

I was just thinking a bitabout how companies can change to better support open source, so why not respond back with some suggestions?

Can suggest:

- donating to projects via Open Collective
- having developer time to contribute back to open source
- stipends for individuals to decide where money goes (like matching donations for non-profits)

Maybe we can come up with a better-edited response that a lot of us can use when we aren't interested but would like to provide feedback about supporting open source?

My original email is below:

> > I came across your Github account and website and, seeing you’ve worked at Behance and extensively in JS, thought you’d be a strong fit for out Sr. Front-End position here.

Yep! I work on JavaScript at work and if you didn't find out from my profile I also work on the open source project, Babel. It's used extensively by many companies, possibly even yours?

Sorry, I'm not currently interested in going somewhere else, unless it's a position that is open source focused (and personally I'm not interested on working something internal like a framework when I'd rather contribute to something the community uses like Vue). Also, I'm looking specifically for a company that would let me work on open source work, like the 50% I have at Behance (ideally on Babel or other JS projects).

I think a lot more developers are going to be asking to work at companies that are contributing back to open source: whether it be donating to important projects that the company uses (we have an Open Collective here: opencollective.com/babel), contributing developer time during work hours to fix bugs, report issues, or even maintain a project like I have at work, or even doing a matching donation similar to a non-profit (maybe give $50 a month to employees for them to choose). If you have any questions about that I'd be happy to explain.

Thanks!
