# Huawei Matebook x Pro PCI-Express 2 lane bandwidth limitations with eGPU

"In short, with current TB3 overheads, 2 lanes is enough to transfer data to the GPU. If you use a display connected to the external GPU, you'll see almost zero performance difference. If you want to use the internal display of your laptop, 2 lanes is not enough, and you'll need 4 lanes to shuffle the DisplayPort data back."

"The MateBook X Pro is not on the [Best ultrabooks for eGPU use] list because the dGPU model uses a 2-lane PCIe connection."
