#### Is this you?

We need a skilled full stack software developer. We use [...] and other tools and technologies such as [...]. We believe in using the best tool for the job while maintaining a slight bias toward the tools that the team knows best. We need someone who communicates just as well as they code, believes in the truth of an idea more than whose idea it is, and is passionate and fearless about new technologies and the ways in which we can work together. And of course, likes to work in a team that respects them just as much they respect everyone else – we like to start our sentences with please and end with thank you, and **rather than jump to conclusions we first ask questions to make sure we all understand each other**.

#### Flexible

We don’t care if you want to work contract or be an employee, where you live in the world, what you wear, if you sleep days and work nights, or some combination in between, just as long as you can give us your full-time commitment, are in it for the long run, and we can find 4 hours between us for collaboration between 9am and 5pm, Toronto time.

#### No Meetings

Yikes! 4 hours for collaboration every day? Sorry, not a meeting, we actually don’t like them, other than for social gatherings and tech shows, we just need some cross over time for Scrum discussions in our private G+ Community.

#### Virtual

If we do need to chat, it’s in a Hangout. Don’t worry, pyjamas are more than okay. Most of our software is built in the Toronto area but we have no office here, we work virtually, but we do have an office in Shawnee, Kansas, if it just so happens you are in that area and prefer bricks and mortar.

#### No Followers

We want opinionated people – “I think we should do this” rather than “tell me what to do” – who are more than comfortable with everyone else having an opinion too!

#### Continuous Learners

We want continuous learners. You share more articles, tech finds, check this outs, than anyone you know. You spontaneously learn and explore, you find having to learn something new is exciting, never scary.

#### Ship Ship Ship

Arbitrary deadlines are just that – arbitrary. But, shipping every day and using dates to keep the focus on, bloat out, and to give everyone else a marker that they can coordinate around, no matter if that marker moves or not, is really important to ship, ship often, ship it good! We are in the process of adopting continuous integration and test driven development – we want to ship 20 times a day. No, we’re not even close. But that is our goal!
