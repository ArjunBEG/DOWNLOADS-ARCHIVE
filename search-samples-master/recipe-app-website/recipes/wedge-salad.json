	"description": "The Wedge salad is so easy to make and there are many variation that you can try. This one uses Romaine hearts instead of Iceberg lettuce and Pancetta instead of bacon.<p>The dressing can be made in large quantities and kept refridgerated and re-used. In a pinch you can find pre-made blue cheese dressing at the supermarket but they often tend to be too sweet or not have a strong enough blue cheese flavour.",
