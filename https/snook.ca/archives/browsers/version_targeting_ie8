	<h1>IE8 to include version targeting</h1>
		<p>I <strong><em>so</em></strong> <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/browsers/ie8_expectations/#c57181">called it</a>. Back in December, I gave my predictions and on the list was version targeting using the <code>meta</code> element. I even said it'd be using <code>http-equiv</code>.  </p>
<p>Aaron Gustafson has an article on A List Apart entitled <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype/">Beyond DOCTYPE</a> that talks about a Internet Explorer's new approach to targeting rendering engines. Like a charset declaration, the <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> declaration can be declared using a meta tag or via HTTP headers, meaning that flipping the switch for all pages on a server to support new browsers will be a 5 minute process. </p>
<p>Here's what the meta tag would look like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=8;FF=3;OtherUA=4&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Although Internet Explorer is first out of the gate to support this, it was designed to be agnostic, allowing other browser developers to use this same approach of version targeting. </p>
<h2>Why do we need targeting?</h2>
<p>The biggest reason is support for legacy web sites. If you think version targeting like this is something new, it's not. We already have a basic opt-in approach to version targeting: the DOCTYPE switch.  The new <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> declaration just takes it to another level.</p>
<p>The fact is, as each new browser comes out and fixes bugs from older versions, our sites need to be revisited. Until we have a chance to do so, our sites shouldn't break. Remember, this isn't about us, the developers, but about the end users who have to visit and use these sites day-to-day. Upgrading their browser shouldn't break the web.</p>
<h2>I don't want to target</h2>
<p>If you decide to do nothing then the sites you design for Internet Explorer will continue to pretend it's IE7. Or, if you didn't use a doctype, it'll pretend it's IE5.5 (I'm guessing here since this is the last version before the doctype switch). </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to make sure your pages always use the most recent rendering engine, regardless, then you can specify that it always uses the latest version. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What still isn't clear for me is how to specify the latest of every browser. Does <code>OtherUA=edge</code> work for all browsers if not specifically mentioned? I'm sure this stuff will get sorted out before long. </p>
<p>I, for one, welcome our new <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> overlords. </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Eric: which standards are those? CSS 1, 2.0, 2.1 or 3.0? And as much as we bash on IE, it affects us the most because it has the largest install base. I once had to use tables on a site because Safari didn't support what I wanted. Of course, it's progressed now to the point where I don't have to worry about it but there is a great deal of legacy code that we have no control over.</p>
<p>Besides, it'll take you 5 minutes to set your server to never have to worry about it again (by setting the header to edge). Just set it and forget it.

		<div class="quote"><p>@nogg3r5, every browser rendering the same would be nice, but unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world.  I don't think this will ever happen, especially as new standards are released.  No one will get HTML 5 or CSS 3 right on the first try, and it is highly unlikely that they will all get it wrong in the same way.</p>
<p>I think this is a good path to go down, and I hope other browser developers decide to support this as well.  If a client hires me to build a website, I don't want to have to check up on it every few years to make sure it doesn't explode with a new browser version, and I would say that most businesses don't want to hire a developer for that reason either.  If browsers can respect older pages, then it gives us developers a firm foundation on which to build.</p>
<p>My only concern is browser bloat, but I would rather see that than webpage bloat which seems to be where we have been heading with CSS hacks, Javascript browser sniffing, and conditional comments.

<p>So regardless of which way you look at it, it requires the developers to change something. Only now, we are putting more trust and faith in the browsers to implement this consistently. I feel like we have been down this path before.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can't come with a solution - there just seem to be so many barriers to both sides (even web standards). I just don't feel right that this is a 'solution.'

		<div class="quote"><p>Many angry people are missing the fact here, that IE wants to do this so they can start SUPPORTING STANDARDS more aggressively. Currently they are reluctant to do so because they don't want to break old websites. It could be possible that with IE9, it could be completely on the same level with Firefox and the rest because they aggressively updated the rendering engine etc.</p>
<p>This whole ordeal is quite funny to me considering the top "experts" in the field are supporting it (and partially microsoft) while all the lowly developers are turning their backs. Sort of against the trend for once.

<p>If the people do not know about EDGE then they are unlikely to be the people that code with standards, or want that behaviour anyway. As I see it this system is brilliant for ignorant web developers. When they test and build their website they will be viewing it in a DOCTYPE derived mode, so either 'quirks' or 'IE7'. Well, their ignorance won't matter to anyone because their page will always render properly, even if they author crap code but have a valid doctype (say someone developing in Dreamweaver...). And if they want to take advantage of the new-shiny they'll have to learn to code properly.</p>
<p>Other people who are not ignorant of the issue can set EDGE. So they win too.</p>
<p>Win/win/win, everywhere.

		<div class="quote"><p>Jonathan, I definately agree.  Something is required to allow future browsers to break free from earlier editions featuring poor standards support.  Allowing sites to set the rendering engine that should be used negates the need for later rendering engines to compromise for the sake of supporting older sites.  This seems to be a reasonable solution.

		<div class="quote"><blockquote><p>its requires people to be able to set the header to 'edge' if they so wanted</p></blockquote>
<p>But if they donâ€™t, then the worst that will happen is their site, <em>when rendered in Internet Explorer</em>, will be rendered as if itâ€™s Internet Explorer 7. If they donâ€™t have enough control over the mark-up to be able to set a meta element, I doubt IE 7â€™s rendering will be an issue for them.

		<div class="quote"><p>I think this is really good for the web. Because I think the new default of 'stay as IE7 when no meta tag found' will <em>enhance</em> the uptake of web standards. Because every ignorant developer on earth is now going to be permanently stuck with IE7 rendering and behaviour. They will never get to use any of the new-shiny of IE8 and above if they don't know to include that meta tag. They won't know to include that meta tag until they go away and learn about web standards.</p>
<p>If I could, I'd have every browser on earth fall back to the current DOCTYPE switcher mode, and current render engines, if any part of the page did not validate. That'd stop ignorant developers simply slinging in the meta tag and carrying on producing tag-soup. It would force valid pages if you want to use CSS3 or the new ECMAScript. And all the while leaving the rest of the web totally unbroken.

<p>Maybe it's my lack of trust in MS, that they now have control over the rendering per a meta tag (or server configuration). As gRegor says, it makes no sense. </p>
<p>Again, all my personal opinion and I have no solution, I just fail to see this as any kind of solution.

If I list FF3 and IE7 and forget to list some exotic browser how should it behave? Should all browsers try to imitate the mainstream ones? Why? It's like introducing quirksmode all over again.

<p>I can think of at least ten people (web designers) who would have no clue how to configure their servers to do this. I could also list off the majority of agencies around me that would have no clue. Honestly, they wouldn't understand one bit. This requirement of 'just update your server' just seems really silly to me. How many times and how many different browser variations will we have for this? One for IE? One for FF? One for Safari? So now - instead of cluttering up our markup with hacks to fix their broken implementations, we now have to clutter up our server config files to send the right HTTP header info. Seriously? How is that a solution to anything?</p>
<p>It all looks like the same pig, just different lipstick to me.

<p>It's looking distinctly like IE will be the only browser to support the header. Today I've read posts from people representing Mozilla, Apple and Opera saying they can't see the benefit in adopting this header.</p>
<p>I remain unconvinced by this idea. My feeling is the default behaviour is back to front.</p>
<p>A major issue to me is one of education. How are MS going to get the message out to everybody developing websites now, let alone newcomers to the industry? It's bad enough helping people get their heads around the quirks/standards mode switches as they stand today.

<p>Sorry Snook, but I have to disagree you and agree with Jeremy Keith here in that if you let MS say this is the only way they can support the spec it is letting the tail wag the dog and that's just not right. </p>
<p>Since when does MS have the kind of power to get to dictate standards support to everyone else? Isn't that exactly what they are trying to do here? </p>
<p>Now sure, itâ€™s a five minute job to change the server headers, but why should you have to, especially when at present itâ€™s just for Internet Explorer? Why is IE so damned special? Market share again? If so then isnâ€™t that all the more reason to hold their toes to the fire to support to current spec instead of creating their own like they did for OOXML?</p>
<p>Also, if the content in those HTML 1, 2, and 3.2 pages is that important to preserve then screen scrape it, park in an XML file, and just be done with it. If itâ€™s the graphics you're after then make screen captures till your fingers hurt for all I care and again, convert it and store in an XML file or in a database. Either way the content is preserved in a format that is usable. Until the next time we run into this problem (which should be within the next five years anyway).</p>
<p>You asked if someone earlier if they would pressure the other browser vendors to live up to the spec just like they were advocating MS should, my answer would be â€œDamn straight!â€ because the other browser vendors are all trying to do that as we speak, WITHOUT having to use version locking like the IE Team is suggesting. </p>
<p>As to the backward compatibility argument, If the only browser your app will run in is IE 4 then donâ€™t you think its time you upgraded? And youâ€™ll say â€œBut upgrading costs moneyâ€ Sure it does, but a better, standards compliant browser is a free download and updating that application from Classic ASP to ASP.NET or PHP (or heaven forbid COBOL) can be done relatively painlessly for a modest investment and you're old app can live in place for the time it would take to outsource your upgrade. </p>
<p>My point is I think an awful lot more scholarly debate actually needs to go on among all parties involved before we saddle up this pony riding headlong once more into the breach dear friends and damned be everyone else. </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Jeff: First of all, thanks for such a lengthy reply. That was a whole blog post right there! :)</p>
<p>Since Microsoft makes the browser, they can do what they want. Honestly, they can. Every browser developer can and in fact, have. If you don't like it, don't use it. The fact of the matter is, the majority of web users still use Internet Explorer more than any other browser. As a web developer, I cater to what my clients want and if they want IE support (warts and all), I give it to them. We've done so much more work to cater to IE's deficiencies that I wonder if this one extra line is just the straw that broke the developer's back.</p>
<p>Anyways, let me offer up a possible scenario here: Let's say I've bought a big enterprise CMS. It's web-based but only works in IE7. This thing cost the company at least $100k, not including all the support required to install and train for this application. A new version of IE comes out and now I can't use the CMS to update the site. Even worse, all the code this CMS spit out to my customers doesn't work either and I've got plenty of support calls to prove it. The CMS doesn't have a new version available yet...what do I do? (and make sure your answer means I'm not spending another $100k+ to solve the problem.) </p>
<p>This is a very real scenario that played itself out very nicely when IE7 came out. And guess what companies did? They stayed with IE6 because it worked. (This is just one of the reasons why the uptake on IE7 has been so slow.) Now, if you tell me that IE8 won't have this problem then hallelujah...let me roll out that browser to my entire company of 1000 people. And guess what, your site that you built with all the latest cool web standards but yes, had to add one line of code, now works quite nicely.</p>
<p>I still think this is the best solution and we can debate it until the cows come home but I'd rather see Microsoft get their new browser with a rendering engine that meets Acid2 out to the masses.

		<div class="quote"><p>I think that there are a few reasons why people have been so negative about this proposal.</p>
<p>1) I'll start with the obvious first, Microsoft is suggesting it. Now it's all well and good saying that people should give it a chance and that just because Microsoft are suggesting it shouldn't be written off immediately. The problem is that nobody trusts them and for good reason too, they have screwed over their end users and developers time and time again. Every move they have made into the standards world seems to be an attempt to destroy the competition by owning the standard. This may be a completely innocent idea from Microsoft but it is going to be a long time of nothing but good behaviour until people start trusting what they say.</p>
<p>2) For that last few years the mantra has been code for the standards not for a browser, adding in browser specific code has been seen as dirty. When flame wars have built up over whether CSS hacks or conditional comments are the better way to go, can you blame people for being shocked when some of the most prominent standards people turn around backed by Microsoft and say actually it's ok.</p>
<p>3) The way that it was announced seemed to have the traditional Microsoft air of backroom deals and shady dealings. There were explicit references to WaSP that made it seem like they were heavily involved as a group, only for a large number of them to turn around and say actually we've not heard about this before today.</p>
<p>4) For the last few years we have had to hack around IE's deficiencies, make special allowances, compromise the quality of our code and all this time the end users have been oblivious to the state of their favourite browser. Then Microsoft announce that IE8 passes ACID2 and we all start thinking that maybe this time it will be better, we might be able to code once and then not spend the same amount of time again fixing for IE, there is hope. Then all of that is seemingly taken away to be replaced with the rod, is it any wonder that people are pissed. </p>
<p>And with regards to IE8's ACID2 abilities surely they fail the test. As i understand it the test should be taken with default browser settings, and in its current state IE7 fails the test. If the new meta tag is used or the http headers are changed to fit then the test has been changed to suit one browser, which means that it is no longer ACID2. As far as i can see it then if this carries on then IE* will never pass the test as it will always be taken as IE7.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of people are missing this point. As a developer, I'm trying to deliver an experience to the user and I'll work with the tools I have at my disposal to do so. If that now includes a new <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag, that really doesn't seem like much of an imposition.</p>

http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/internet-explorer-7-were-you-ready</p>
<p>You can think MS has a secret plan to lock people into its products like Silverlight, but I don't see how this meta tag can fit into its evil plans.</p>
<p>Also, with the standards we are using today (HTML4, XHTML1 and CSS 2.1...) that are now stable, clearly, IE is the only one that need this tag. But with HTML5, JavaScript2  and CSS3 coming, other browser might need it in the feature if they start to implement them when they are not finish.

<p>I see your point, but still, the way MS handled this whole debacle leads one to believe they haven't learned anything from their earlier mistakes despite what Chris Wilson says. Why must they always do everything so clandestine, blackbag and covert? I know its their option to do so, but its an option that just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>You think they'd want the development community to know "Hey we're working on a new version and we'd like your help!" After all, just look at how much community support there is for Firefox and Webkit.</p>
<p>I think if they'd be more open and more forthocming with the developer community as a whole I bet that it would go a LONG way to restoring the trust developers now lack in and for MS and IE.

For purely historical reasons it never used a doctype so ran in quirks mode, with a purely IE userbase.  To the client adding the doctype was an expense with no payoff, so it never happened. But more recently we discovered that the quirks mode rendering time was 5-6 times slower than standards compliant mode. Their app has been unfairly been perceived as slow as a result for years.

<p>Because user agents have bugs in how they implement the standard.  Let's say Microsoft claims 100% CSS 2.1 compliance in IE8, but then after IE8 ships they find bugs in it.  When IE9 ships with those fixes, this could cause sites targeted at IE8 to now break.  This same scenario happens with other browsers today -- it's just that the perception of the breakage depends on the size and type of your user base.</p>
<p>Until every browser is bug free (which, since code is written by humans, is quite a long time), there will always be compliance bug fixes, which all have the potential to cause disruption.  Targeting a UA version, not a spec, is required to minimize this disruption.
