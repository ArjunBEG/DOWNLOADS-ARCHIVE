	<h1>Font sizing with rem</h1>
		<p>Determining a unit of measurement to size our text can be a topic of heated debate, even in this day and age. Unfortunately, there are still various pros and cons that make the various techniques less desirable. It's just a matter of which less-desirable is most desirable. </p>

<p>There are two main techniques that are extolled:</p>

<ol>
<li>Size with px</li>
<li>Size with em</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's review these two approaches before I reveal the magical third.</p>

<h2>Sizing with px</h2>

<p>In the early days of the web, we used pixels to size our text. It's reliable and consistent. Unfortunately, users of Internet Explorer&mdash;even in IE9&mdash;do not have the ability to change the size of the text using the browser function of increasing or decreasing font size. For those concerned about the usability of their site, this may be a big deal. Recent versions of IE include zooming, which increases the size of <em>everything</em> on the page&mdash;a feature that is also available in most other mainstream browsers, too. This has helped mitigate the issue to a degree.</p>

<p>I, personally, have been of the camp that px-based layouts provide the consistency I prefer and users have enough tools available to adjust their view that accessibility is less of a concern. But I digress. What else can we do?</p>

<h2>Sizing with em</h2>

<p>That whole inability to resize text in IE has been a continuing frustration. To get around that, we can use em units. Richard Rutter's article, <a href="http://clagnut.com/blog/348/"><i>How to size text using ems</i></a>, was probably the first I read of this approach, way back in 2004. (Wow, it has been almost seven years.)</p>

<p>The technique modifies the base font-size on the body using a percentage. This adjusts things so that 1em equals 10px, instead of the default 16px. To set the font-size to the equivalent of 14px, set it to 1.4em.</p>

<pre><code>body { font-size:62.5%; }
h1 { font-size: 2.4em; } /* =24px */
p  { font-size: 1.4em; } /* =14px */
li { font-size: 1.4em; } /* =14px? */
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with em-based font sizing is that the font size compounds. A list within a list isn't 14px, it's 20px. Go another level deeper and it's 27px! These issues can be worked around by declaring any child elements to use 1em, avoiding the compounding effect.</p>

<pre><code>body { font-size:62.5%; }
h1 { font-size: 2.4em; } /* =24px */
p  { font-size: 1.4em; } /* =14px */
li { font-size: 1.4em; } /* =14px? */
li li, li p /* etc */ { font-size: 1em; }
</code></pre>

<p>The compounding nature of em-based font-sizing can be frustrating so what else can we do?</p>

<h2>Sizing with rem</h2>

<p>CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". If this hasn't put you to sleep yet, then let's look at how rem works.</p>

<p>The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root&mdash;or the <code>html</code>&mdash;element. That means that we can define a single font size on the <code>html</code> element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.</p>

<pre><code>html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
</code></pre>

<p>I'm defining a base font-size of 62.5% to have the convenience of sizing rems in a way that is similar to using px.</p>
<p>But what pitiful browser support do we have to worry about?</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find that browser support is surprisingly decent: Safari 5, Chrome, Firefox 3.6+, and even Internet Explorer 9 have support for this. The nice part is that IE9 supports resizing text when defined using rems. (Alas, poor Opera (up to 11.10, at least) hasn't implemented rem units yet.)</p>
<p>What do we do for browsers that don't support rem units? We can specify the fall-back using px, if you don't mind users of older versions of Internet Explorer still being unable to resize the text (well, there's still page zoom in IE7 and IE8). To do so, we specify the font-size using px units first and then define it again using rem units. </p>

<pre><code>html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
</code></pre>

<p>And voila, we now have consistent and predictable sizing in all browsers, and resizable text in the current versions of all major browsers.</p>

<p class="update">Dec 13, 2011: Opera 11.60 now supports the rem unit.</p>

<p>I have to test the "rem" unit as soon as possible.<br />
The browser support doesn't seem so poor and the fallback follows the same logic than what I already do for rgb / rgba colors, that's cool.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing !

		<div class="quote"><p>Fantastic!<br />
I've been using Rutter's 62.5% font sizing technique for years and, while I love using it, the compounding em problem has been a thorn in my side ever since. The introduction of rems to css3 is a great solution and it's nice to see that most modern browsers support the feature. Definitely will implementing rem in my work.

		<div class="quote"><p>Thanks for the explanation!<br />
This is great because it matches the way I work already. In most cases I set a base font size for body text and use multiples of that for the rest of the visual hierarchy. This is going to make all those calculations easier.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Don't know how I missed out on the rem unit, thanks for enlightening me!</p>
<p>A recent solution I've used to counter the 'compound' effect leverages CSS variables available in pre-processors like less and sass:</p>
<p>https://github.com/peteboere/preset/raw/master/library/variables/font-sizes.css</p>
<p>Basically you set up a library file of CSS variables that map absolute pixel sizes to em values. For example a variable 'f16-12' would equate to 12px absolute size over 16px base font size.

		<div class="quote"><p>Great article. Itâ€™s a nice overview of the techniques we can use when we want to target specific amounts of pixels for font sizes. I may start to use the technique you highlight (`html {font-size:62.5%}`, pixel sizes + corresponding font-size with rem).</p>
<p>But with all this focus on getting a precise pixel font-size in the end, it feels like weâ€™re missing the point of proportional font sizes (%, em and rem). Isnâ€™t the point of using those units to let the user agent and/or the user decide on a default font size (not always 16px)? Then we would just focus on whether the websiteâ€™s design requires text that is slightly larger or smaller than usual, and on the difference between body copy (base font size) and headings, UI text, etc.</p>
<p>My take on this is that if we want pixels, we should use px and be done with it. The way IE handles px font sizes means that the px+rem technique can be useful, but weâ€™re still thinking in pixels. In a time where screen resolution ranges from roughly 60 to 320 dpi (60 to 200 if you donâ€™t count the iPhone 4â€™s display), SVG gets widely implemented and CSS decoration properties allows us to reduce or eliminate decorative background images, we may need to change or mindset and work on or px addiction. :)

<p>REM's look like a brilliant "future web development" browser feature. The fact that you can fall back to PX and start using this RIGHT NOW is beyond awesome.</p>
<p>I'm going to investigate using it in an Adaptive Web Design / Template I'm working on...</p>
<p>How exciting! Thanks for the tip!

<p>Even better, don't set the base font size at all; respect the user's settings.  Just size elements such as headings proportionally larger.

		<div class="quote"><p>Awesome. I remember hearing about rem a few years back (2007? - Firefox 1.5?) but then it had zero browser support and was only something to be considered in the really far future. And sadly, it still won't be safe to implement rem in at less a couple of years, I think. IE8 and below still have a too large piece of the market share.

<p>Default font size isn't a function of user preferences; it's a function of history. Browsers started using 16px as the default size years ago, and every browser since has had to use this garishly-large size for compatibility, and probably will for the foreseeable future. There's nothing wrong with managing the size for body appropriately for modern browsers. Don't forget, the Web looked a lot different when 16px was chosen as the default.</p>

<p>If your goal is to eliminate font sizing problems, then why implement a technique that causes font sizing problems for a different set of users?</p>
<p>Will declaring a fixed font-size of 10px in the body or html element prevent IE/Win users from resizing other elements based on ems?

		<div class="quote"><p>I always used 62.5% on body combined with em method, however I don't see too many benefits in using the rem. </p>
<p>First of all, if you want to support IE7/8 you need to always add the fall-back size in px. From my experience, when using ems, the only reset you need to is for nested lists.<br />
Trust me, it is easier to add few lines of code than adding both px and rem sizes for all elements.</p>
<p>For websites that need only IE9+ support I think is a great new function but it is not ready for deployment yet.

		<div class="quote"><p>I'm with mister Triplett on this one. Setting the root Font size in % only works the way u want if the user hasn't touched his browser settings,  if his font size is set to 14, ur effectively making things a lot smaller than u expected. So this assumption isn't only bold, but sorta rude as well. Like if someone would order a large sub and he'd get a small one instead...<br />
I Usually define my root size in px and add controls if the project requires font scaling. Agreed, it's equally rude, but more accurate.

<p>Another technique to avoid unwanted em-based cascade:</p>
<pre>
  /* use child combinators (supported from IE 7) */
  div#context_element &gt; ul &gt; li {
    font-size : 1.25em; /* will not compound on nested
<li /> */
  }
</pre>
<p>Note that I also tend to use px (12 is a nice baseline and the em math is still pretty simple... round at the 1000th place) and "reset" at various key points (e.g., forms)

<p>That being said, you could use em font-sizes in a pre-IE9 only stylesheet (included using IE conditional comments) to have the best of all worlds.
