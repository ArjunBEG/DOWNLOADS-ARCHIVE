	<h1>Minimal</h1>
		<p>I need to document all the stuff that went into this design but for now, I'm happy just to have it launched.</p>
<p>Why did I redesign so quickly after the last one? Because I wanted to! Inspiration struck and I ran with it. In the end, I'm much happier with this iteration over the last one and  I'll be happy to keep this around for awhile.</p>
<p>Like the last version, I used HTML5 sparingly. Simple doctype, cleaner syntax for some elements like script and link tags. There's lots of graceful degradation going on here (or progressive enhancement, if you're a glass-half-full kind of person). I checked it out quickly in Firefox 3.5, Safari 4, Opera 10, and Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Everything else, I'll just assume looks okay.</p>
<p>No, I still don't use a CSS reset. I didn't use a separate stylesheet for IE. My single CSS file comes in at a reasonable 8k. </p>
<p>This has been a year of change for me in many aspects and this design is a reflection of my continuing metamorphosis. This redesign will hopefully kick off a renewed enthusiasm in myself for design and development and blogging about it every step of the way as I had once done before.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>One site in particular that kicked off the whole desire to redesign was <a href="//seansperte.com/">Sean Sperte</a>. I've also been inspired a bit by <a>Jina Bolton</a>. It was also a chance for me to try something that looked simple but has some layers of complexity to it and I feel this design comes close to that.

		<div class="quote"><p>Feels a bit WWII militaristic, though I just finished watching Valkyrie and saw your tweet-announcement. Think it's a combo of the condensed capitals, typewriter-style uneven pressure on the gridlines, and non-bleached texture. Could seal the deal and make the copy monospaced &ndash; or not. Looking good nonetheless.

		<div class="quote"><p>Nice, I like it! Interestingly, when I first saw the site I instinctively tried to scroll upwards, following a subconscious urge to uncover the upper part of the logo in the background ;-)</p>
<p>Two suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right now the links in your navigation have a very small clickable area; I think a little padding-top would do them good. Maybe the font you're using has funny metrics?</li>
<li>Also, their text doesn't need to be all-caps in the HTML code since you're giving it <code>text-transform: uppercase</code>.</li>

		<div class="quote"><p>First less of you!..then less of your website, a case in showing that more isn't always better. </p>
<p>By the way it was a plesent short read about your weightloss in your previous post, something i seem to be piling on at the minute due to the leaving a fulltime physically active job for full time sitting behind this screen all day!</p>
<p>The site looks great, clean simple nice use of  League Gothic by a good company. and as always the content is king! </p>
<p>@markus I actually like the fact that the link has states as opposed the the space around it! and the use of text-transform to me is really a backup not a problem! ;)</p>

<p>I sort of miss the widespread use of green though, something that has become associated with the snook.ca site image. That's just a small thing though right? ;)

		<div class="quote"><p>@<a href="#c63877">Markus</a>: The navigation does need to be tweaked and padding-top should do the trick. The reason for <code>text-transform:uppercase</code> is actually a technical one. Both Opera and Internet Explorer don't use the uppercase letters from the subsetted font. As a result, I had to literally type the letters as all uppercase. </p>
<p>@<a href="#c63883">Vladimir</a>: I wanted the categories to be hidden. It's all part of the minimalism. Hopefully the heading is enough for people to see how to dig in. If not, I may tweak it. As for the footer, yes, my intention is to beef it up with a lot more info but wanted to push the site up live.</p>
<p>@All: if you want to reminisce over the old design, there's thankfully Flickr to the rescue: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/booyant/3834338130/">Version 9</a>, <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/solarfrog/492096844/">Version 8</a>, <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/clivewalker/334947411/">Version 7</a>, <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/digerati/141844160/">Version 6</a> and finally <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/the-owens/137520026/">Version 5</a>.

		<div class="quote"><p>Agreed that the new design is very nice. If ever I get my act together and re-create my page, I think this will be a design that will influence my aesthetic.</p>
<p>On to being a semantic jerk, I consider "progressive enhancement" and "graceful degradation" two different things, as they explain how you tackle the problem. Do you start with the basics and then enhance or do you create the end product and then figure out where things need to fail "gracefully". I think PE is the way to go right now, since IE is in the mix. As HTML5, &lt;CANVAS&gt; and &lt;VIDEO&gt; get some major traction, though, I think we'll be able to reduce our reliance on legacy cruft and design just for modern systems. Or I hope.</p>
<p>In any case, great design!</p>

<p>That said, it'd be neat if the little ribbons, stars, etc., <em>did</em> something. I half-expected the one next to the post title to function as a permalink (since it looks like a bookmark); the same goes for the one by the "Conversation" heading. Maybe some <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus</code> trickery, such as the ribbon being colorized (or in the case of previous entries on the main page, the ribbon fading in to replace the star) would add a little bit of interactive pizazz?</p>
<p>That's just a suggestion, though--I've noticed that you use the ribbons, etc., in the design in ways that don't lend themselves quite so easily to the bookmark metaphor. And even as-is, the design is no less lovely!

		<div class="quote"><p>@<a href="#c63924">Nathan</a>: The headings use LeagueGothic which is an open-source font and allows embedding. (Although, the license was a little confusing to find. Hopefully I understood it correctly.) I was also pleased as punch that the file was only 20k as some fonts can really be quite sizable. As for the other one, I went to extreme measures to create a subsetted font file which contains only about 30 characters. There's not a full alphabet and there's only 4 lower case characters being used. This kept the file nice and small (only 8k) and is hopefully enough to avoid any issues (but will be understanding if I have to change it).

<p>p.s. h2 font on the article headings are huge in Chrome</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Like the new design, especially the sort of finger-printy bit. Minimalism will always keep coming back as no design ever remains untouched - you always end up adding a bit here and a bit there, until one day your realize that you've ruined it and need to start again - of course that's also half the fun of making websites.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip about the noise filter too.

<p>I came in here with images disabled, so I'm seeing the <em>really</em> minimal look. I'll have to take another when I put images back on.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Love it.</p>
<p>And reading through the comments, it's fascinating how polarizing a design can be - there are more than a few people that felt the previous, busier design was nicer â€” and that's more than valid. But personallyâ€”as someone who pours over design sites way too muchâ€”I often feel so inundated with busy, bright, <em>designed</em> sites that seeing something so spare and clear feels like a long, cool drink of water: refreshing and sustaining.</p>
<p>I remember once reading an interview with John Cougar (Mellancamp, at the time) when a question about the simplicity of his song structure prompted him to say that if he ever found a way to tell his story using only one chord, he would do it.</p>
<p>On a final note, you beat me to the punch. Ever since seeing it on the <a href="//www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">League of Moveable Type</a> site, I've been longing to do a redesign with League Gothic.</p>
<p>Looking forward to reading your posts here, Snook. Cheers.

<p>I LOVE the background. The texture is so subtle that you can't miss it :-) want to share how you created it?<br />
Noise filter in photoshop and playing around with colors I would assume?</p>

<p>The minimal design is lovely â€” great improvement â€” @font-face usage too, very snazzy...</p>
<p>How did you manage to subset to only some charaters in Gotham? Seems like a good half way, I've seen some demo versions of expensive fonts distributed this way so perhaps it's ok? Or a least worth trying on a non commercial site.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Tom-c: I used FontForge to delete any unused glyphs and then exported as TTF, which I then used to create an EOT. I wanted to use font-face, keep file size down (Gotham is 160k in a single weight), and try to prevent it from being used on other sites. Hopefully they'll be okay with this non-commercial usage of it and the steps I went through to protect it.

<p>Guess i'd better get brushed up on FontForge then, is there anywhere in particular you learnt about the specific options you mentioned for successful .eot files?</p>
<p>I've tried using the online converters with League Gothic and had little luck so I guess FontForge will have my answer.</p>
<p>Also did you install CLI only on OSX? If so any particular ./configure options?</p>

Took me a few seconds to realize that your slogan on the left was actually the link to Home. The sidebar is also quite naked at the moment. I don't think I'd mind having the archives be open by default. But to each their own. Overall a deluxe job!

<p>I debated about whether to link of the Snook.ca but decided against it because of how close it was to the line below. I wanted to avoid people accidentally clicking on the wrong link. That may be a premature optimization but it seemed like the right thing to do. I may switch it up at some point just to see what happens. Maybe some click-tracking is in order. :)
