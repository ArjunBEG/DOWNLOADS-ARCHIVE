	<h1>V8: Supercharger</h1>
		<p>Version 8 is launched. Oh crap. </p>
<p>Well, I've decided to have some fun and call this &quot;Supercharger&quot;. It's been months in the making.  Seriously. It's gone through iteration after iteration but I finally think it was good enough to launch. It's been tweaked and prodded all the way to the finish line. And this isn't even done yet (as is probably obvious in a few places). This isn't even a late <a href="http://cssreboot.com/">Reboot</a>, an event that I believe is now past its prime. </p>
<h2>Death of Fixed Comments</h2>
<p>Okay, I didn't <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/other/death_of_comments/">get rid of comments</a> but I did get rid of fixed comments. It's been a staple of this blog for years but I've finally retired it. Sort of. They'll be making a small return when I get them implemented but they'll be much different than before. You'll have to turn them on manually, for one. They'll also be fixed at the bottom as a full-width panel. </p>
<p>Trying to use fixed comments was fun but it's actually a pain to design around. You basically give up a column of design real estate for them. That's something that I didn't want to do any more.</p>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<p>The last design was essentially a single column design. Any other information was at the bottom. Oh sure, it's all &quot;content-centric&quot; but I felt like cool stuff was getting lost down there. It's lonely at the bottom! </p>
<p>As you can see, it's now three columns. And no footer. Except a rather large rendition of my logo. Just in case you forgot where you were by the bottom of the page. Like the overdose of green wasn't enough. </p>
<p>The three columns gives me more real estate &quot;above the fold&quot; to highlight various things. There's still a few things to make their way into the sidebars. Nothing major but </p>
<h2>Self Promotion</h2>
<p>Mind you, calling it &quot;self promotion&quot; sounds icky but I did want to highlight some of the personal projects that I've been working on. They now have a place in the sidebar. I should have a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssdesign1/">link to the book</a> there soon, too. </p>
<h2>More to talk about</h2>
<p>I hit a bit of a lull within the past couple weeks, not posting much as I focused on client work. That won't change much in the next couple weeks either but should hopefully pick up after that as I wrap up various projects.</p>
<p>Anyways, I somewhat rushed  this out. I still have some tweaks to make and I'll have a follow-up post that I want to do talking about the design of the site. I had a lot of fun putting this one together and I think you might be interested to see how the design  progressed and the thought that went into many elements that you see within the design. </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Great job on the redesign btw, I love it!</p>
<p>All the headlines in your articles are floating (have equal margin on the top and bottom, which makes them float in-between paragraphs rather than belonging to one). Might want to fix that the the sake of legibility.

		<div class="quote"><p>Wow, this new design is amazing.  Once again you've pushed the limits.  My favorite part has to be the roll between the commentor's name and comment.  I did notice one bug.  When you are looking at all the comments and individual has made, the commentor's name overlaps with the about snook/projects section on the left side.

		<div class="quote"><p>Very nice looking design. I have been following your blog for sometime now but haven't commented yet. Not sure is it just me, after reading 3-4 comments look to the right side, I see fading white lines corresponding to the green lines(comment border). I like the preview type appearing in the bottom of the comment section too.

I think the typography still needs a little work, looks a little cramped to me (more line-height?)<br />

<p>@Matt: I've actually left the typography alone for a reason: I want to see how usable the site is before I go messing with line heights too much. If I find the readability a little difficult, I'll play around with it some. I did the same thing with the previous version, too.</p>
<p>@Lucian: no plans to release the blog code. Mostly because much of it is really unpolished and very specific to my site. I doubt it'd be of much use to anybody over and above the many blog tutorials that come with most frameworks these days.

		<div class="quote"><p>For the most part, I really like the new design, however, I do have one criticism, and it's bad enough to make me think my monitor is wonky or something.</p>
<p>But what is up with the blue/grey banner at the top? Besides the fact that the color is in quite a bit of disarray with the rest of the site, it's artifacted pretty badly, and the type is pretty pixelated (or artifacted).<br />
The footer portion with the logo is quite nice, though it has a bit too many sharp pixels hugging the circle, for my taste.</p>
<p>Overall, I this is a great improvement over the last one, and I especially enjoy the new columns. Much easier to navigate and grok the site's content and flow.</p>
<p>Overall, good job :)

<p>One small bug I found: once the comment numbers go into double figures they tend to overlap the author's name a little, especially with the wider figures like 30 and 00 in the comment preview.</p>
<p>Apart from that it's all beautiful.</p>

<p>@Nate Cavanaugh/Andrew Ingram: I've re-exported the header image. Hopefully it's a little cleaner now.</p>
<p>@Sam Rayner: interesting. There shouldn't be any overlap until it hits 3 characters but it seems like it might not be a bad idea to find another place to put them. Thanks for the heads up. I did notice the spelling mistake on the book page but it hasn't bugged me enough to send them an email about it. :)

		<div class="quote"><p>Great re-design! I love how the divisions between each of the comments makes the center column pop out to the front. The darker green flanking the outside columns was a good choice. And the strong logo at the bottom is killer.</p>
<p>Just one thing, though - if the browser is anything less than 980px wide the horizontal scrollbar is needed to access the right column (including the main navigation). Normally I would chalk this up as a usability issue only, but considering your audience I doubt it's that much of a problem. </p>
<p>But in Firefox, Opera and SeaMonkey (at least) the portion of the right column that is off the right edge of the viewport is not visible when using the horizontal scrollbar. In IE7 you can get the main navigation, but the remainder of the right column is still cut off. Let me know if you would like the screen shots I've taken.

But as a UI element, I found it a little jarring when you begin to scroll down to read further down an article, and then WOAH!! your eyes zoom back up to the top and your thought pattern or read-flow is taken on a detour or sidebar, if you will. (Damn! You can think of a better use of that pun jeremy!)  Anyways, well done!

<p>I really like both the header and the footer, but i think the orange feed icon and the coloured version of your projects stand out too much compared to all the green. perhaps make them green/semi transparant and light them up when you hover over them?</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Kilian: I've upped the line height and things definitely feel more comfortable. As for clutter and the sidebar, I used contrast and the shadow to emphasize the main column. This will hopefully create enough balance that I can keep the elements as-is in the sidebar. I do want them to be noticeable without being distracting. Time will tell if that's the case.</p>
<p>@Jason Kataropoulos: I wonder that, too. :) It was originally intended to keep the business and the blog separate but I haven't had time to add a serious portfolio and as a result, it's languished somewhat. I may bring the pages into the new design but I think I'd still want to create something unique for the landing page.

		<div class="quote"><p>You mention areas of the page but don't explain what you think needs refining. Could you expand on that?</p>
<p>It seems the bended lines (e.g. the seperator lines in the comment area and commentor area form a unity through the swoosh-like bended line) are pulled from your Snook lettermark, this could be merely a coincidence. This could be an idea to expand on.</p>
<p>the shadows on both sides at the comment blocks area could  be reworked to achieve a different effect, it sort of looks like a shadow treatment we have seen once too many.</p>
<p>the logo you added both top and bottom could fucntion like a high contrast styleswitcher indicator??</p>
<p>The logo area has this shadow and looks kinda blocky and out of place with the rest of the site elements. This could be an indcation you could rework the different site elements to be more liike complementary. the header and e.g. the typographic treatment seem to much, it could be interesting to work with the footer idea and sort of workout that for the header?</p>
<p>What do I know?

<p>Two things though: First, your background-image (http://snook.ca/img/v8/ft.jpg) with the burst(?) is too cool. I think it would be cool if it were more central or visible though it hasn't ever seemed your style to go overboard with the logo so maybe thats not your style.</p>
<p>Secondly, and I know its not overly cross browser but you might implement a minimum height value for the "post" content or at least for the sidebars to prevent this: http://img369.imageshack.us/img369/7048/screenshotgo5.png

		<div class="quote"><p>I have to say, this latest design is your best one yet, and I'm glad the fixed comment form is gone. As much as it was cool, it was also kind of annoying when I was reading your blog without any intention of commenting. Also, I think the presence of two sidebars really doesn't hurt the focus on content at all.

<p>Great work, as always. Maybe a tad too bright for my taste (or it might be the high contrast of my screen). I wish you long life, happiness and prosperity!</p>
<p>I haven't read the book yet but it looks yummy! Could it be useful if I've already Transcended CSS? ;)

		<div class="quote"><p>Very hot design, excellent job. </p>
<p>However...<br />
1. Too bright: I feel like some areas seem oversaturated with color, a bit hard to read.<br />
2. Your comments: Whenever you make a comment, the background turns green and the text turns white - it's tough to read, I have to highlight the text.</p>
<p>But I love the footer and most elements. Great job overall, but you should do something about the legibility.
