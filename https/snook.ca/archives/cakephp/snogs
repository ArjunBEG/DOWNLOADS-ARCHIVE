	<h1>Snogs</h1>
		<p>If there's ever a quintessential application to build when you first dive into a framework, it's the blog. That's what I did with Snook.ca when I first got into CakePHP. </p>
<p>Then for a recent client project, also built using CakePHP, I was asked to integrate a blog. I took this opportunity to take a chunk of the code I used to build my own site and break it out into its own blog plugin: <a href="http://cakeforge.org/projects/snogs/">Snogs</a>.</p>
<p>Snogs is Snook's Blogs and is a simple multi-blog engine for CakePHP. It's hosted over at CakeForge where you can download the application, access the Subversion repository or supply feedback. </p>
<p>I'm releasing this as open source. If you're interested in joining the project and enhancing Snogs then by all means let me know. Also of note, I've included the <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/other/effective_blog_comment_spam_blocker/">spam component I talked about previously</a>.</p>
<p>While my own site doesn't run off of it, it will. I'm intending to rebuild much of Snook.ca using Snogs to see how well everything integrates and it will no doubt inspire me to add some features I find useful. </p>
<p>(And let me know if you're getting tired of all these Sn- prefixed projects. I think it's fun but there's always too much of a good thing.)</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Sounds interesting, I've been interested in trying out CakePHP for a while, but haven't managed to find a suitable project (or the time), if I ever get around to using Cake, I'll be sure to try out Snog. I assume it takes care of some of the back-end admin stuff behind a 'blog' as well?</p>
<p>And for the record I quite like the Sn- prefixed names, no different to (but much more creative than) Apple sticking 'i' infront of everything, or Automattic adding -press to everything.

<p>First thing I noticed: You've used a mixture of php short tags (&lt;? ?&gt;) and long tags (&lt;?php ?&gt;). I'm presuming the long tags are from baked code.</p>
<p>This is going to break on a fair few installs (mine included) :-(

#2 The default class for Author is set to be User would be better if it was Author - things would work more out of the box<br />
#3 Some kind of namespacing of tables is needed - comments, categories are very commonly used models - robs the plugin of some plugable-ness.<br />
#4 Gave an SQL error on line 64 of posts_controller with RC1 - the syntax has changed.<br />
#5 +1 to what Richard said </p>
<p>That said - there are a lot of code ideas which I am going to pick up from the plugin - thanks a lot for sharing

		<div class="quote"><p>@Richard/Tarique: Thanks for the feedback. The short tags are a habit of mine and I knew that'd be one of the first things people would point out. I also haven't used "var $name" which is necessary for PHP4 support (or at least it was). Namespacing the table and the Model names are equal issues, imo. I wish PHP had package support like Java to help prevent namespacing issues.</p>
<p>@Tarique: lots of helpful advice. awesome!</p>
<p>I'm always happy to hear that people are getting ideas out of how the code is put together. To be honest, I always feel like I'm not doing it the "CakePHP way". Of course, in the end, as long as it works. :)

<p>Anyway, good to know there is such plug-in for Cake. Who knows if I build a system and somebody ask me for blog plug-in I would know where to find it ;)</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Snook, aside from what others have mentioned above (namespacing would definitely be nice), was there a a reason that a post can only be attached to one category? Your post table has a category_id, what if a user wanted to attach a post to more than one category?</p>
<p>I like the work you put into the spam prevention, those extra steps make it very nice.</p>
<p>Other than that...i think it's awesome that you released this as open source for others to use. And, obviously, the sn prefix fits perfectly, it's part of your brand, so it must stay, always.

		<div class="quote"><p>@nate: I debated whether or not to do a HABTM relationship, along with possibly adding separate support for tags. I decided to do just a simple hasMany with the intention of adding tags down the road. It came down mostly to my own needs first and I don't use multiple tags (despite the fact that my own blog actually uses a HABTM relationship).

		<div class="quote"><p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>I've started to play with it and I like the idea, just wanted to contribute and I'm implementing Tarique's suggestions:</p>
<p>#2, #3, #4 and #5 are done.</p>
<p>I'm working on switching the SQL to schemas.</p>
<p>Also did some improvements:<br />
- autogenerate slugs if none provided<br />
- support for upercase letters in the slug (routes)</p>
<p>I can send you the patches (I'm working it with git) if you are interested.</p>
<p>- Regards.</p>

<p>Some more improvements on my list are<br />
#1 RSS feed for comments (all comments  and one single post)<br />
#2 Admin route protection if Auth component is being used

<p>@Tarique: RSS feeds for comments on an individual post are already available (maybe I need to recheck that). Admin routing protection is a good idea.

		<div class="quote"><p>peter: the status indicates whether the comment is approved (2), in moderation (1), or junked (0). The junk_score is the result of running the spam component on the comment, which gives you a score. It's a way of tracking how well certain comments perform and allows you to tweak the metrics as need be.

<p>Guys, how are you accessing the SVN? I've tried the URL, provided at CakeForge (https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/snogs) passing my CakeForge usernane but I keep getting this error:</p>

<p>@Jonathan: Is what's in the repository (rev. 2) the latest  codebase? Any chance that some of the improvements mentioned by commenters in this thread might make their way through to the repo? I'm planning on migrating a wordpress blog to a CakePHP driven one and was hoping to use your code. But  I guess I should wait for the CakePHP 1.2 final release before all patches are integrated. Thanks indeed!

		<div class="quote"><p>What, would you say, is the benefit of building your own blog as opposed to using something like Wordpress? I would like to build my own blog in Ruby on Rails, but I don't know if it's worth the effort. I just learned RoR over the summer and love it. I have already used it on a project for one client. It was an easy switch from CakePHP (which I learned 2 years ago from your suggestion), but I feel it's much cleaner and easier to program in.

		<div class="quote"><p>It all depends on what your needs are. The basic requirements of a blog are posts and comments. Maybe categories and/or tags. You get a system with only what you need. If you want any special fields, you can add them. Managing an application like that is simple. </p>
<p>But then you think about what something like WordPress can do... multiple authors, trackbacks and pingbacks, templating, plugins, etc. If you're trying to replicate all that, then maybe you should just use WordPress. You have to decide what that balance is. For me, going custom made the most sense (and that was after years of using Movable Type).
