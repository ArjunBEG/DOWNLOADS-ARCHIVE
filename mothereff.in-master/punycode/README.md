An internationalized domain name (IDN) is an Internet domain name that contains non-ASCII characters, such as a language-specific script or alphabet, such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Hindi or the Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics, such as French. These domain names are stored in the Domain Name System as ASCII strings using Punycode transcription.

This is a tool that uses [Punycode.js](https://mths.be/punycode) to convert domain names between Unicode and Punycode (ASCII).
