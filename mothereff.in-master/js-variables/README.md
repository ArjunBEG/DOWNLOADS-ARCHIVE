# [JavaScript variable name validator](https://mothereff.in/js-variables)

Wondering if you can use a given string as a variable name in JavaScript? This tool will tell you. It validates identifiers according to ECMAScript 6 and Unicode 8.0.0, but also shows warnings if an identifier would be invalid as per ES5, or if an ECMAScript 3 reserved word is used, or when an otherwise valid identifier would not be valid under Unicode 3.0.0.

See [_Valid JavaScript variable names in ES6_](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6) for the full explanation.
