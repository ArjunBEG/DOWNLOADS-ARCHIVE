	<h1>No CSS Reset</h1>
		
<p>When asked recently about using a CSS reset stylesheet, I readily admitted that I don't use them. I don't use them for my blog or for any project that I work on. Admitting such can raise an eyebrow or two. Reset stylesheets are definitely becoming commonplace &mdash; as you'd expect with companies like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Yahoo</a> and industry leaders like <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer</a> actively using them.</p>
<p>So, why haven't I jumped on board? </p>
<h2>What is a CSS Reset?</h2>
<p>In case you've never heard of such a thing, a CSS Reset is designed to set a number of element styles to a specific baseline that creates consistency across various browsers.</p>
<h3>In the beginning</h3>
<p>When the idea of a reset style was first introduced, it was very basic. It reset the margin and padding for all elements. The problem with that was it caused havoc with elements that didn't want their margins or padding reset (namely, form elements).</p>

<pre><code>* { margin:0; padding:0; }</code></pre>
<p> From there, people worked on adding to and fine-tuning the reset stylesheet to be more flexible and to reset more styles. The <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Meyer reset</a> is probably the finest culmination of this effort.</p>
<h3>Eric Meyer's Reset</h3>
<p>Eric Meyer's reset took the concept of resetting margin and padding and took it to a whole new level, stripping styles from a number of elements, forcing you to think about what you wanted and add them back in. List items would no longer have bullets, headings would no longer be bolded, and most elements would be stripped of their margin and padding, along with some other changes.</p>
<h2>Working with Nothing</h2>
<p>The problem I've had with these resets is that I then find myself declaring much more than I ever needed to just to get browsers back to rendering things the way I want. As it turns out, I'm perfectly happy with how a number of elements render by default. I like lists to have bullets and strong elements to have bolded text. </p>
<p>And I'm okay if the various browsers show things slightly differently. </p>
<p>I'm okay if one browser displays an H1 a few pixels larger or smaller than other browsers. If one browser defaults to circle bullets and another to squares, that's usually not a problem. If it is, then I create a style that addresses that specific issue. I don't reset it back to zero and then set it again to what I really want. </p>
<p>One of the principles I took away from the Web Standards community was the concept that pixel perfect precision across the various rendering engines was impractical and a remnant of the table-based layouts of yesteryear. With CSS and progressive enhancement, it was okay that things might look a little different from one browser to the next because of variations in what they supported.</p>
<h2>Building up </h2>
<p>With that said, the idea of developing a base CSS file that defines some common styles that I often want from project to project &mdash; like turning off margin and padding for form elements &mdash; is a good idea. </p>
<p>We're seeing various CSS frameworks crop up such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> and <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a>. Each  breaking the system down only to build it back up again. Each starts with a reset, then adds on typography and a grid system.</p>
<p>Each of those still seem like more than I need, even though none are that large in size. Blueprint is the heaviest at around 13KB uncompressed but also includes lots of extras like styles for error messages and a print stylesheet.</p>
<h2>Less is more</h2>
<p>One of these days I'll put together my own base CSS or maybe I won't. To date, I haven't felt myself being overly repetitive in the styles that I set; and I haven't thought to myself, &quot;oh, the hours I'd save myself if only I had a reset stylesheet.&quot;</p>
<p>So, while I have nothing against CSS reset stylesheets, I simply don't use them personally and I think that's okay.</p>

<p>Im still getting to grips with that! However, i guess it also depends on one's comfort level of how varied a browser render you can tolerate. In my case, its still close to very low.

		<div class="quote"><p>I completely agree. Every time I start a project and attempt to use a pre-made reset (be it Meyers, BP, etc) it always seem to cause more work in the end. I end up canceling out or undoing half the elements from the reset (headers!).</p>
<p>I think have *some* sort of ground work to start off of be efficient, but unless the project specifically needs it- I just haven't found it beneficial.</p>
<p>I periodically go back and try using different resets- but I always end up at the same conclusion. Maybe one day my mind will change and my design habits will incorporate a reset file.</p>
<p>Great write up btw. It's good to know there are still some other designers left out there that don't use resets.</p>
<p>Cheers!

		<div class="quote"><p>Resets can certainly be a pain - if you're not sure exactly what it is doing. Once you know the things that it will cancel out (and what it won't) it's not too difficult to specify the styles that YOU want (opposed to the browser).</p>
<p>Certainly there is a lot of negativity in pixel pushing and it can be many a web dev's nightmare but unfortunately from my experiences people really do want things to look the same across platform/browser and CSS resets can/will/have help with this.</p>
<p>I've certainly been frustrated with them in the past but now rather like them :&gt;

		<div class="quote"><p>I agree with your points, however I still use the reset css. In fact I use quite a heavy reset by default, but instead of adding bits back in (such as making strong text bold again) I just remove those things from the reset. I find this works for me.</p>
<p>I've also looked at a few of the prebuilt css frameworks and can't say I'd use any, of them all I think the popular Blueprint framework is the worst. Take time to develop your own, not only will it work better but it will help you develop your own skills further.

		<div class="quote"><p>I use a very basic reset, literally just for margins and relative font sizes. I've never really seen the necessity to create a fully clean slate. As long as it renders roughly the same in each browser it's fine. If you're constantly adding in CSS that was already there as a default then you're wasting your time. The browser defaults are all very similar anyway.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that a full reset is merely an attempt to be 'overly semantic' (if there is such a thing) with your code.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Whole-heartedly agree.  The last thing I want to do is start from scratch.  I agree on building up a base - such as with font sizing - but brining all elements back to zero seems overkill.  Add in http requests, page weight, maintainability, and I think the cons out weigh the pros.  Migrate the code to a new developer, and you can be in even deeper.  </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>It's an interesting discussion. While I do agree it's sometimes a matter of taking out just to put back in, there are other times when it is very important to be able to give the end user a good user experience.</p>
<p>While most people are aware that pixel-perfect designs are, more or less, impossible to achieve (it's a living medium, not a poster, folks), there are times where you want to be as accurate as possible when it comes to creating a result which is as consistent as possible across web browsers and platforms.</p>
<p>I generally use a small reset part in the main stylesheet (not tucked away in a hidden file), and I'm fairly picky about what I reset.

		<div class="quote"><p>I have a number of gripes with reset stylesheets:</p>
<p>In Meyers reset styles outlines are removed from focused links, with the rational that you have to put them back in as you want. This is very bad in my opinion - the inverted dotted outline is distinctive and understood as a usability convention - should <em>Never</em> be messed with or altered from the browser default.</p>
<p>Also removing bold from headings, italic styling from em elements etc. Is overkill. every browser that I've ever seen has the default styles set intuitively in the obvious cases - and they're there to help the authoring process - I certainly appreciate them.

		<div class="quote"><p>Yay! About time somebody (at least somebody with a blog that gets read) mentions the non-essentiality of reset stylesheets. I don't use them and find that when I have, I've spent most of my time re-emboldening header elements and such like. After stripping away the margins and padding I'm then quite happy with how most browsers render my site. Some sites of course may require a little more 'stripping' than others - but once these areas have been identified, then its a two-minute job to set a targeted reset for them.<br />

<p>The link outline is only removed from Firefox iiirc, this outline can look pretty nasty at times and can even interfere with the page rendering in some instances. </p>
<p>Instead use the :focus pseudo class to apply the same styling as :hover, that way there are no issues tabbing through page links and the user still receives feedback.

<p>This is fine, and perfectly valid, but seems to reject the reset sheets from the approach that they are Things Not Edited, which Eric explicitly addresses on the page for his: "It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline." If you instead prefer your B tags bolded and ULs bulleted as a starting point, it's trivial to produce your own "fork" of the Meyer reset to make it so. Rather than a final product, I'd just think of them as someone having already done some of the work toward that personal base sheet you're setting aside for the future. With Eric's at least, there's a pretty strict adherence to a single goal, eg. the reset. </p>
<p>The problem I have with some of these and the frameworks is that they have a tendency to go a few steps too far. Blueprint, for example, defaults to centering your layout, which I don't think it has any business deciding for you. And I'm also questioning of so many colors being specified in the typography module. I don't use that portion at all, but conceptually I'd prefer that it stick to metrics and leave color up to the users rather than require them to repeatedly contradict the Blueprint author's choices.

<p>I agree with the fact that the reset stylesheet issue has got a little out of hand. Yes, some elements - such as lists - need their margins and padding standardised to reduce headaches, but I like the idea that headings and form elements should be allowed to display as originally intended across different browsers - the users of those browsers are used to the way these elements look so why confuse them? </p>
<p>Vive la difference!

<p>One of the greatest hurdles for me when I first started learning CSS was trying to figure out what mystery properties were being applied in order to try to offset them.  So much of my time was spent zeroing out things haphazardly because I wasn't sure where all the mystery margin or mystery padding was coming from.  This becomes even more frustrating when you learn that different browsers come with slightly different "defaults".</p>
<p>With a reset stylesheet, I no longer have to have all of those different defaults floating around in my head.  I start with a fresh slate and specify just exactly how I want it to look.</p>
<p>Do I think some go too far?  Sureâ€”why unbold the strong element?  But largely, I think it helps people better wrangle CSS, so I recommend it to all beginners.

		<div class="quote"><p>I've been using the universal reset for awhile, and finally got tired of not being able to style inputs.  So I took Meyer's reset and slimmed it down.  I left in a lot of the defaults such as sizes, spacing, and bullet points.  I do end up writing over what is left, but my reset helps a lot in simple avoiding confusion later in development.  It keeps me from wondering, "Why is that element way over there?  Oh, it's a browser default..."

<p>Since I've used a reset the amount of browser-targeting hacks in my CSS has dropped by 70%. Not to mention the high level of control I have with font-sizing.</p>
<p>The complaint of 're-enabling' all seems pretty insignificant. Sure it sucks and it's not often you need to declare <code>b,strong{font-weight:bold;}</code>. But, you really only need to build your baseline stylesheet once, and then you can use it on all subsequent projects.</p>
<p>So to me, getting that solid consistent cross-browser foundation is absolutely worth the time.

		<div class="quote"><p>Some great comments here. I didn't realize this was all that controversial an idea. I have to say though, I'm a little confused by all the comments saying "I always have to add/remove _____ from Eric's reset.css" Why not just add/remove them once from the reset.css itself instead of undoing his stylesheet in yours?</p>
<p>The strong/em thing got me too at first. I think I forgot he removed styles on those too so I just went and put them back. I change a few other things too, adding a hr style for a simple line and adding nathan smith's div.clear, and my .hide-for-print class. Things like that which don't have an immediate effect on the design themselves alone, but things which I am typing (or copy/pasting from my other stylesheets), are all things I've added to Eric's. </p>
<p>I also have a base.css which gives me fonts and margins on headings and paragraphs I use a lot, and even some comment/calendar styles for wordpress but I'm finding myself undoing some of those a lot so I'm thinking of just making a "blog" reset, "corporate" reset, etc. for those different uses.</p>
<p>And you're right, I haven't saved a ton of <em>time</em>, but I like to think I'm preventing carpal tunnel. :)

<p>Another thing I'll mention is that I got used to coding around browser defaults, and now sometimes when something doesn't work I'll end up spending two hours trying to fix it, only to realize that it wasn't really broken. It was something that was reset in Meyer's reset.css.</p>

<p>But I've been on the other side of the reset.css methods/ideas and I don't want to go back.  Hell no.   We're working with layouts that, I would imagine, you want to be *consistent* ... isn't that right?  Being all willy-nilly about "oh I don't care if it's a few pixels off" - will eventually bite you in the ass down the line when a client throws down on some weird inconsistency because their lame "enterprise" throws you a curveball that isn't accounted for, therefore forcing you to hunt down the rabbit hole for all selectors that might touch those elements ... fixing margins, then having to fix more, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Madness.  Start off with a consistent baseline, throw out the incongruous variables that can drive you NUTS in the future, and then have a beer.  Or something.

		<div class="quote"><p>While I absolutely understand your reasoning (after all, you are defining way less CSS without a reset), and seeing the comments have about the same sentiment, I think you (and most others) would be on the complete other fence when it comes to javascript or HTML.</p>
<p>Would you want implied behaviour, that's about half of what the browsers thinks it should have, and half of what you define? And have it differ between browsers ever-so-slightly? I think not.</p>
<p>This is exactly the thing a CSS reset does for CSS: It takes away the <em>implied</em> CSS styles, the styles you <em>can not count on to actually be there</em>. </p>
<p>Without a CSS reset, you built on top of them without being sure that they're actually defined, let alone defined as you want them to. That seems rather illogical, doesn't it? Sure it works now, but what if the standard CSS of a new browser version differs just slightly enough as to breaking your layout? Then you'd have to go back and rectify it. With a CSS reset there would not have been a problem.</p>
<p>Having said that, just do what you please. If not using a CSS reset works for you, then that's awesome and don't let anyone but yourself change that :)

<p>I've used both the YUI CSS framework and the Blueprint CSS framework. I have to say both are pretty nice, thought he YUI one doesn't validate which bugs me. I think the Blueprint framework is awesome, has tons of potential and gives you the ability to programmably write mark-up. &laquo; I know people are going to hate that statement, but in the world of web applications not web pages, programmable XHTML output is very beneficial.</p>
<p>As for the comment about Blueprint adding to your page weight; it's extremely small when compressed and severed via gzip (anyone have numbers on this?).

<p>I did recently try using Eric Meyer's reset on my blog - thought I should give it another go as it had been a while since trying resetting - but I actually found myself just taking elements out of the reset to return them to their defaults. It was just more than I needed.</p>
<p>Instead I just tend to have a semi reset rule which removes margins and padding for the elements that I find need it as I go along.  Much lighter!

		<div class="quote"><p>I agree in part.<br />
For your average blog, or mid-sized portfolio website or CMS, I don't believe a CSS reset is really needed, or even very useful. After all applying a lot of rules to * is fairly render heavy.<br />
But, if you have ever worked on a large scale web project, something with a heavy code base and a development team, the qualities of a hard-reset start to come through. I've been working the last year for a company who's product runs into hundreds of thousands of LOCs, and over 10,000 lines of CSS. It's not bloated or heavy, it's just a very big website. We built our own reset from scratch which in turn rebuilds every element in a very specific fashion, most of them fairly differently to browser default, with exact and purposeful spacing and rules. It took a lot of tweaking at the start and takes maybe 300 LOCs. When this is combined with a custom element layout framework the problems it solves when using many many elements over and over in different scenarios is priceless.<br />
Though the key point there is that everything is hand written for our needs, out-the-box resets or frameworks are one of the worst ideas ever, because as you say, the majority of the code is redundant.

<p>Take all of those 'reset' rules, and, for every selector, figure out the margins, padding, etc. you prefer. That way you have your own "framework" to use over and over.</p>
<p>I am working on such a framework for myself now. I won't need to use the reset after I'm done, because every HTML element selector will have the initial properties I prefer.

It does save me a little time, however, as I develop more sites I'm noticing a pattern in how I use styles in relation to my markup.  Because of that, I'm thinking about reworking my reset style sheet.  I've noticted on elements like unordered list, the only time I really want bullets is in an article/post of some sort...  in most other cases it's being used in navigation or something else where I'm not going to have bullets, but rather my own set of styles.  So if in most cases I don't want bullets, it'll be easier on me to go ahead and reset an unordered list rather then basically reseting every separate unordered list on the page as I need it.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I like the idea of it dealing with different browser issues ahead of time, so I don't have to worry about them nearly as much when writing my styles.</p>
<p>Some styles, like the p tag, I reset and then set again in my reset style sheet.  This way it will have the spacing between paragraphs without me having to specifiy that everywhere I use a paragraph tag.  All I have to do is include my reset style sheet.  Over all I think it's saved me a considerable amount of time.

<p>That's hardly the case at all and I think you missed the point. The point is that a slight variation between browsers does not take away from the reader's experience and I don't feel the need to strip down all styles only to add them back in. If I need to address something specific, I will create a style addressing that issue.

<p>Pixel-perfect replication across the gamut of browsers <b>is</b> a silly goal, but it is still the goal for a lot of clients, and they get angry if you don't do it that way. Having a standard reset helps to get closer to that goal. Anything aside from what can be explained away by font rendering issues still frustrates clients.</p>

<p>Now, Jon/Steve/Bryan and I have recently discussed the reset topic, and it's interesting to see the pros/cons coming out here in the comments &mdash; as a pixel-anal designer (the same goes for Bryan), I <strong>love</strong> stripping the default styles down to a common base set, and building up from there. True, font rendering can't always be consistent (yet), but just about everything else <strong>can</strong>, and if every pixel counts for you, resets are a great way to reduce some headaches, and though I only recently started using them, I'm already in love.</p>
<p>To address XLCowBoy's comment above: it isn't "rubbish" to say that minor variances between browsers/platforms are acceptable - if they don't impact the visitor's experience, such discrepancies are part of designing for the web (#1 varience for me: I specify Helvetica before Arial, so many sites I build will have a different typeface on OS X &amp; Windows. Is that a discrepancy? Of course; a problem? Not likely.).</p>
<p>And Jon's not saying you shouldn't reset styles that don't work for your needs, so if your goal is pixel perfection, go for it (with or without a specific "reset" stylesheet).

<p>Guess what? Apple's website <a href="http://snook.ca/testing/applediff.gif">does NOT look the same in every browser</a> (pardon the oversized animated GIF to prove my point). Maybe Apple <em>is</em> mediocre. In fact, they're most consistent when they use images for text (especially the home page). Even funnier? They DO use a global reset... (the store seems to use *{} and not a variation on Meyer's that the home page uses).</p>
<p>So, yes, I <em>still</em> don't think a global reset solves the pixel perfect precision issue and will continue to create styles that target my design. No need to demolish the building when all I need to do is rearrange the office.</p>

<p>Once again I will take the opportunity to reiterate my initial comments.....It doesnt matter if you use a reset or not....as long as you or your client is happy with the result then it is all gravy.  I've had clients literally not care what their site looked like as long as it was clean in IE7.  I personally strive to make all sites look good in all browsers without spending too much unnecessary time on it.

<p>Which makes style sheets very complex (the universal reset bug). CSS used cleverly is so <a href="http://css-class.com/test/delta.htm">simple</a> (best viewed in Safari 3.1). Hopefully the CSS WG will allow empty strings in substring attribute selectors since I see many use cases for them.</p>
<p>Jonathan, you are part of the CSS eleven. Can you please consider that these (empty string) selectors should keep existing behavior in all browsers that support substring attribute selectors or for the CSS WG allowing me the time to show how they can be used. I begging.

<p>You say how you want things to look in the first place. So a base style sheet is how you want a page to look?</p>
<p>You are knocking down margins and paddings and building them back up again. This is adding unnecessary CSS.</p>
<p>The design shouldn't really be about what you want but rather be open to the needs of the audience of a site. You are trying to have to much control and one reason authors desire such control is due to the expectations of a client or clients seeing the space on a web page as real estate.</p>
<p>Resize a page on the average site. Two bumps on text resizing and chaos breaks out (overlap).</p>
<p>Resets may have been of great help in 2001 but now we in 2008. IE8 is in beta and now we have a much improve consistency across browsers concerning margins and paddings. Let resets be a handy tool of the past and lets move forward into the future.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p><a href="#c58125">@Alan</a>:</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you for taking the time to look at that <a href="http://jdclark.org/tests/base.css">example</a> on my <a href="http://jdclark.org/">personal website</a>. To answer some of your questions about my <a href="#c58116">previous comment</a>:</p>
<p>I'm not saying that this is how I want a page to look, rather how I want it to look <em>in the first instance</em>. I am aware that there is some redundancy in the style sheet: this is just to get a consistent starting point. I've never bought into the idea of "expensive" selectors &mdash; I mean, I appreciate a fast-loading and efficient website as much as the next guy, but can anybody seriously say that there is a <em>noticeable</em> difference in rendering times of pages that employ say, for example, the <code>*</code> selector?</p>
<p>What I've tried to do is build a rock-solid "default" that declares everything explicitly, without leaving anything to chance. The perfectionist in me (and I suppose everyone else in the "vote yes for reset.css" camp) knows that without the user-agent's default styles applied, there will be some gaping holes (although the fear is admittedly irrational). It is just being thorough.</p>
<p>I think the best thing is for us (<abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr> the entire web dev community) to agree to disagree on this matter. I respect both sides of the argument, and I believe there is a place for <strong>both</strong> methods &mdash; it's just a matter of taste, and depends on what the project requires.</p>

<p>I think that if you are always using common elements with the same basic starting point that it is wasted effort to redo it every time. </p>
<p>Jonathan, I agree completely with the POV that pixel perfection is a waste of energy and that if a person is using browser x they are not going to go check it to see if it looks different in another browser. That is our job. If the site doesn't break or if there are rendering issues we haven't done our job.

<p>I've recently taken to using Eric Meyer's reset but to be honest I've found it more trouble than it's worth, due to having to re-declare a lot of things later on. Personally, I find the effort of doing that far outweighs the apparent gains that are made in having the 'clean slate' -- chances are that the tweaks you need for differing styles across browsers will be required anyway, regardless if you reset them initially or not.</p>
<p>So I think I'll be ditching resets on future work.

<p>Of course you wouldn't want your site to look that way. Re-read the part that I quoted ;-)  </p>
<blockquote><p>Is to have a "base" style sheet, based on Eric Meyer's "reset.css", which specifies how I want things to look in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand where you coming from. Basically the user-agent style sheets of the various browsers are not consisted and mixed with bug behavior we can expect anything to happen (10% inspiration ~ 90% perspiration). But now we have Gecko 1.7~1.9, Safari 3, Opera 9.5 and IE8 all showing greater constancy with CSS2.1. This is happening now and soon (hopefully) we can say bye bye to the magical IE bugs and bye bye to Opera specials bugs (just to make it all the more challenging for us).</p>
<p>The rock-solid "default" which we all desire is that foundation to build a page on. This rock-solid "default" was first seen in Phoenix (Gecko 0.6) in 2002 since it was also greatly CSS2.1 compliant. It's a shame that it has taken 6 years for all the other browsers to catch up. You say that the web development community should agree to disagree on this matter, but truly what are we disagreeing about?</p>
<p>@Leon</p>
<p>2001 is one static point in the past. We have the present (April, 2008) and we have the future. Form the tiny developers, browser implementors and spec writers, there is 'something' sort of happening. It's like some chains and anchors are all holding some of us back in 1996. This is the year <strong>that browser</strong> Internet Explorer was release upon the wold. Some are constancy haunted by this scary though that we may have to be backwards compatibly with IE5 forever.</p>
<p>What I am suggesting to all the web developed community is to see over the horizon. Now already we have almost compatible behavior in Gecko 1.7, Safari 3, Opera 9.5 and IE8. No time ever in the history of the the web have all major browser versions been in beta. This is the year that the web can break those chains from the past forever.</p>
<p>The web is not stuck in the past. It's part of a collective mindset that is trapped in the past. The year is 2008 and if you believe it the future is ours for the taking.</p>

<p>But seriously, I can't believe no one's mentioned Tripoli yet. I've used it for several projects, and it's convincing me that reseting is the way to go.

<p>Currently on the CSS WG list there is some discussion which started with this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Apr/0474.html">message</a> on <a href="http://css-class.com/test/css/defaults/UA-style-sheet-defaults.htm">CSS2.1 User Agent style sheet defaults</a>. The final style will allow implementors to standardize the default style sheet, thus the end for a need for a CSS reset.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://css-class.com/test/css/defaults/default-margins.htm">test case</a> shows all the default margins for in-flow block elements. IE8b has come a lot closer with the other implementations especially with list defaults.</p>
<p>@Kris</p>
<p>I still design for IE6 and IE5 (they get the same style). You just have to understand the IE bugs and the possible workarounds if there are any. The same can apply to IE7 and IE8 or any other browser. That is why I call using CSS resets the <strong>universal reset bug</strong> but this bug doesn't affect the browsers but rather the CSS authors. ;-)</p>

<p>I have a reset I use for building scalable HTML websites:</p>
<p>* { margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; font-size: 10px; }<br />
* * { font-size: 1em; }</p>
<p>and then you have to set * * { font-size: 10px } for IE6, else it will die.</p>
<p>Then 1em is equal to 10px on all elements. The * * rule is required to stop inline elements spilling all over the place in FF.</p>
