	<h1>Becoming a  Font Embedding Master</h1>
		<p>I've spent a couple days worth now trying to figure out the best and most complete approach to font embedding using <code>@font-face</code>. It really is a dark art that must be mastered. It is by no means a straightforward process.</p>
<h2>Font Formats</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, these days, a font on our system is going to be one of two formats: TrueType (with a .ttf file extension) or OpenType (with a .otf file extension). While it would be nice to be able to just throw a font like this on the web and link it up, we're hit with two major limitations. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Licensing, and</li>
  <li>Browser Support</li>
</ol>
<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>Licensing is one of the biggest hurdles. It can be difficult to find a font that really works within the overall aesthetic of a design. It's the reason we've had to resort to exporting images, <a href="http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr3/">sIFR</a> or <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about">Cufon</a>.</p>
<p>Even many free fonts have limitations on how they can be used, often times requiring specific directions on linking back to the original source or only using them in non-commercial sites.</p>
<p>These days, a number of resources are popping up&mdash;especially those dedicated to font embedding. A good start to finding the right font for your project would be <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a>. Font Squirrel even provides <code>@font-face</code> kits to make implementation on your web site easy. However, even these kits don't provide as complete of browser support as what I'm covering here.</p>
<h3>Browser Support</h3>
<p>Which leads me into the other major issue, browser support. Font embedding with a TrueType or OpenType font only works as of Firefox 3.5, Safari 3.1, and Opera 10. (You can enable it in your copy of Chrome 2 by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17818">using a command line switch</a>.) </p>
<p>Okay, that's  decent already but we can do better. We can get Internet Explorer 4+, Chrome 0.3+, Opera 9+ and even a little mobile Safari action.</p>
<h2>EOT</h2>
<p>Internet Explorer supports a particular type of format called Embedded OpenType that provides some control over where and how the font is allowed to be embedded. You'll need to convert your TTF  into an EOT format. Microsoft provides a tool called WEFT but it is ancient and I'll be damned if I can get it working. Thankfully, there is a command line tool called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/">TTF2EOT</a> that can convert your font. </p>
<p>If you have an OTF file, you'll need to convert it into a TTF file before you can convert it into an EOT. <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a> is the application that I use to do it and has provided me with the most consistent results. I urge you to check out my <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/screencast-converting-ttf2eot">screencast on OTF to TTF conversion</a> using FontForge as it is a surprisingly tricky process.</p>
<p>As you'll soon see, having the file in a TTF format will help us with the next step.</p>
<h2>SVG</h2>
<p>With TTF/OTF and EOT, we have decent browser coverage but the coup de grace is to add one more font format to the mix: SVG. SVG fonts are supported by Chrome 0.3+ without having to use a command line hack, along with Opera 9 and (with  testing provided by the Twitter folk) iPhone OS 3.1. Additional mobile browsers may support it as well but I have been unable to get thorough confirmation on this.</p>
<p>FontForge has an option to export to an SVG format but I was seeing odd behaviour in Opera with missing characters. Alternatively (and thankfully!), I found a Java application that can be run from the command line called <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html">Batik</a>. When running the conversion, you must specify the ID parameter. You won't get an error if you don't but the ID is important at the CSS stage.</p>
<pre><code>java -jar batik-ttf2svg.jar ./MuseoSans-500.ttf -o museo.svg -id museo</code></pre>
<p>One of the concerns in exporting to SVG is file size. Immediately I had noticed that my 29k font was now sitting in well over 100k. The biggest reason was the number of <code>hkern</code> elements that, I guess, are meant for kerning. (I'm smart like that.) However, you should be able to delete them without greatly impacting the display of your font but greatly impacting the file size. The other thing I noticed was <code>glyph-name=&quot;null&quot;</code> on all of the glyph nodes. I was able to remove them with, once again, no impact to the display of the font. Having done so brought my SVG fonts to the point where they were smaller than the original TrueType font I had converted from (29k to 20k in one case and 18k to 12k in another case).</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>Now that we have our three files&mdash;TTF (or OTF), EOT and SVG&mdash;it is time to get our CSS mojo on. Starting with <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/">Paul Irish's bullet-proof base</a>, I've added an additional entry for the SVG font.</p>
<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'GothicCustom';
    src: url(&quot;LeagueGothic.eot&quot;);
    src: local('League Gothic'),
       url(&quot;LeagueGothic.svg#lg&quot;) format('svg'),
       url(&quot;LeagueGothic.otf&quot;) format('opentype');
}</code></pre> 
<p>The <code>font-family</code> name that you specify here is arbitrary and I like to choose a unique name to make it clear in my other declarations that I'm using an embedded font. </p>
<p>The SVG syntax has one particular thing of note, and that is the ID anchor after the font name. Specify the ID that you used when doing the SVG conversion. Alternatively, open up the SVG font and make sure that the font element has an ID. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;font id="lg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Specifying <code>font-family</code> works as it normally would. Just specify the font name that you used in your <code>@font-face</code> declaration.</p>
<pre><code>font-family: 'GothicCustom', 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;</code></pre>
<h2>Subsetting</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/screencast-converting-ttf2eot">screencast</a>, I gave a quick demo of how to subset a font by clearing glyphs that aren't to be used in the final font. Why would you want to subset a font? It makes the file smaller. Some font files can easily weigh in at 200k. That's a lot to download when people don't need to. For example, the masthead on this site is&mdash;as of this writing&mdash;using Museo Sans. A great font that weighs in at around 65k. Since the masthead only uses a limited set of characters, I was able to remove anything I didn't need and brought the file size down to 20k.</p>
<p>If you optimize your images, why not optimize your fonts?</p>
<h3>Text Transform Bug</h3>
<p>There is one caveat to be aware of when subsetting. In my case, I assumed that I could quickly do without most of the lowercase glyphs. A <code>text-transform:uppercase</code> statement was all I really needed.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;About&lt;/div&gt;

div { text-transform:uppercase; }</code></pre>
<p>This works fine in Firefox and Safari but Opera and Internet Explorer both seem to decide whether to use a font for a particular character by looking at the lowercase character first. This meant it was using the uppercase characters from a fallback font. That's certainly less than ideal. </p>
<p>Of course, you can always just change the HTML source to be uppercase, if you were dead set on removing those glyphs.</p>
<h2>Print Style Sheets</h2>
<p>When I first set out to use <code>@font-face</code>, I didn't even foresee this added bonus: the custom fonts also work just fine with print style sheets. It wasn't like using image replacement techniques and having to fall back to a boring browser font for print. It felt good printing off a page of my site that still used the same fonts as what I saw on screen.</p>
<h2>Never Going Back</h2>
<p>Despite the frustration, I've come to the conclusion that&mdash;if the design called for it&mdash;I'd rely on <code>@font-face</code> over sIFR and Cufon. I really prefer not having to use JavaScript and I enjoy all the other benefits that come from using <code>@font-face</code>. I certainly look forward to the future when all of these headaches are no longer necessary.</p>

<p>It's great to see SVG fonts get their proper respect here. For those that are interested, <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/about-fonts-in-svg.html">Divya Manian has done some great research on SVG fonts</a>.</p>

I had <a href="http://twitter.com/kimili/statuses/4693165565">one report</a> of a "Nokia N900 prototype (running Maemo 5 w/ a mobile Firefox build)" that was successful. I emailed PPK to see if he was up for the challenge if I provided him a test case. Hopefully we'll have something more concrete in the coming days.

<p>@<a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/becoming-a-font-embedding-master#c64001">Lars</a>: I have to admit that I didn't test in Opera 9 so it's certainly possible that it's not supported.

I spent some time adding an @font-face the other day after watching your screencast, and felt like I learned a ton, but ended up falling back to Cufon after i found the serif font I wanted rendered like crap on IE in particular but also a little funky on some other Win browsers. Font-sizes weren't terribly small at 18px and 14px. </p>
<p>The san-serifs did okay.</p>
<p>Wondering if you found issues with that, and did something pre-@font-face or other?</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@<a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/becoming-a-font-embedding-master#c64015">Bonfield</a>: I haven't seen fonts rendering too poorly but I have chosen fairly straightforward fonts. It's quite possible that additional hinting information is being lost, causing it to display poorly in IE. I don't have any specific workaround for that.</p>
<p>@<a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/becoming-a-font-embedding-master#c64016">Andy</a>: Sorry to slight you. It was unintended. Did you do the write up to <a href="http://nova-group.se/test/fonts/">the article you linked up</a> from my last post? If so, thank you. It's where I found the Batik converter. I tried to clarify in this post that SVG isn't necessarily smaller without some additional work. Further optimizations to the TTF could also be made to improve file size, too (I don't believe I removed the hinting in my fonts).</p>

<p>Also, I converted the font in full from TTF and the SVG ended up half the size of its TTF counterpart. I guess this could be coincidental and specific to that font. Either way, I would not recommend anyone to use the fonts without first optimizing them, of course.

<p>@Linus: As was mentioned in the article, SVG fonts are supported in Chrome .3+ and Opera 9. If you're happy with the cutting edge browsers, you don't have to worry about this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SVG is just cool, so having another use case more really rocks. And my personal measuring on GaramondNo8 (GPL font) shows me a saving of 308kB in file size from the TTF to the SVG version. *That's* a reason for switching, and I didn't even remove the hkern elements.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>This is probably THE single best article I have read that summarizes the @font-face attributes to deal with the various browsers. So far I've had to put this information together on my own (and have come to the same result, except for the SVG option, which I just started investigating today).</p>
<p>All's well so far, EXCEPT that I can't get the SVGs to display in CHROME 3.x what-so-ever. I know that SVG should be working, based on the demo here: http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/751/SVGfonts_in_HTML.html</p>
<p>Any ideas as to why Chrome would not render these out? I also tested it using FontSquirrel, a great site, btw, and it wouldn't work with the font kit provided, either!

		<div class="quote"><p>I noticed something: you can test if your SVG font works by browsing directly to it in Chrome. I noticed that none of my fonts would display, while other SVG sets I downloaded did in fact work!<br />
I will have to resort to locating fonts that work in SVG as well - I have a strong suspicion that the free fonts I was using had many overlap errors and other issues, and as such didn't export properly to SVG.

		<div class="quote"><p>Sorry to keep updating in the comments like this - I hope it's not too much.<br />
I identified why some SVG fonts will not render: the all-important DOCTYPE in the SVG file.</p>
<p>FontForge created this DOCTYPE:<br />
&lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd" &gt;</p>
<p>This did not render. After downloading and instpecting a working SVG font, it turns out that it did not have a DOCTYPE. After removing the DOCTYPE from my own SVG files, they all render out.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not exactly sure what the implications of this are. Can anyone elaborate on this?

		<div class="quote"><p>One thing I noticed with the @font-face tag, is that when you zoom in on text in Safari ( not sure if it's the same in Firefox and such), it blinks for a second.</p>
<p>So let's say you used a special font for your headers (like in your case Jonathan).<br />
- Zoom in, and I noticed that it blinks back to Times for a second before showing the increased size of the @font-face font.</p>
<p>I'm on the latest version of Safari, but it was very noticeable. Not sure if this is because of the way some people use the @font-face tag, or a bug in html5, or simply something in Safari itself, but it's a bit strange :)</p>
<p>Having said that, I can't wait to have this see implemented in all browsers though... the idea of being able to use this tag without fear is very appealing :)

<p>Question: If people have their IE security settings set fairly high, any page that has a @font-face embedded font will make IE pop up a warning dialog stating something along the lines that the page is trying to install something. </p>
<p>Clicking OK allows it to load the fonts on the page, but every page you visit continues to pop-up that warning.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on getting around this warning message (other than telling people to lower their settings)?</p>
<p>BTW: I've tested this on WinXP w/ IE6/7/8 - All give this warning.
