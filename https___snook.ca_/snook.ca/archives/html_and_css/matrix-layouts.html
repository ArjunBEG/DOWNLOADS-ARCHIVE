	<h1>Matrix Layouts</h1>
		<p>This post isn't about what you think. This isn't about some handy little CSS technique you can implement right now. Not yet, anyway. This is about an idea that I've been working on. An idea that &mdash; I hope &mdash; will one day help you and me build better web sites. </p>
<p> I've come up with <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/matrix-layouts/">my own layout specification</a>. </p>
<h2>Um, why?</h2>
<p>Who in their right mind would ever want to do something like that? Apparently, I would. Here's the thing. Some people compain and don't offer  solutions. Layout with CSS does have its drawbacks. I've gone through table-based layouts. I do float and position-based layouts. I understand the limitations that exist and I've lived them. Rarely do I complain about it. </p>
<p>Would I like something better? <strong>Yes</strong>. I'm not going to complain about it, though. This is my offer of a solution. <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2009/02/17/wanted-layout-system/">Eric Meyer wants a layout system</a> and I'm going to try and give him one (and the rest of us can enjoy it, too).</p>
<h3>Don't we already have layout approaches in the works at the W3C?</h3>
<p>Yes. We have <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-layout/">Template (aka Advanced) Layout</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid/">Grid Positioning Module</a>. I feel that the former is too complex and the latter under-defined (and so is mine, but we'll ignore that for the moment).</p>
<p>Coming up with a layout, considering the constraints of plugging this approach into existing systems, isn't easy. It's been almost a month since Meyer's missive (which is what inspired this whole crazy idea). Whenever I had a few moments (driving, right before sleep, sitting on the toilet), I'd try and think of how this could work. It's surprisingly hard. Every now and then I'd think I'd have an idea. I'd consider how inheritence would work, how it would work with other positioning systems, and the idea would break down.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="http://twitter.com/snookca/statuses/1303962803">inspiration struck</a>. I spent an hour that night writing my idea down. I talked about it to a couple people. Nobody understood. I did up a first draft &quot;spec&quot; and people sort of got it but were still heavily confused. I revised it some more and added a use case. Now it started to click for people. (In other words, they weren't completely disgusted by the idea.) Maybe it's ready to share to a larger audience.</p>
<h2>So, what are Matrix Layouts?</h2>
<p>Matrix Layouts are like table-based layouts combined with absolute positioning. It only adds one new property value and tries to build on existing concepts (margin, border, padding, z-index and all that other fun stuff still works the same). Will it be the perfect solution for all your templating needs? No. I already see areas where it's less than ideal. But it'd be better than what we have now.</p>
<p>Here's how it essentially works (in a nutshell): You use the position property to specify where the box should be placed within the grid. Let's look at the following example diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://snook.ca/technical/matrix-layouts/grid.png" alt="Example Grid layout with 3 columns and 3 boxes under the second column" /></p>
<p>It's a 3 column design but with a little extra pizzazz in the middle column. I've also lettered each section by their source order. Now, let's look at what that code would look like with matrix layouts:</p>
<pre>#a { position: matrix(1,2, 1,4); }
#b { position: matrix(2,2); }
#c { position: matrix(2,3); }
#d { position: matrix(2,4); }
#e { position: matrix(1,1, 2,1); }
#f { position: matrix(1,5, 2,5); }</pre>
<p>The container is essentially broken down into a grid of rows and columns, the number of which are defined by the highest number of rows and columns defined by any element within that container. The matrix value takes up to 2 pairs of numbers. The first pair is the top left  and the second pair is the bottom right. If the second pair is ommitted then it just uses the first pair. (In other words, it would only use one square in the grid.)</p>
<p> If you've seen the Advanced Layout draft, you'll probably see some small similarities. It's not as powerful as Advanced Layout but hopefully this simplicity offers it the chance to get implemented sooner rather than later. This sort of looks like table-based layouts but with independent source order (and a couple other bonuses that aren't covered in this little example).</p>
<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
<p>It is definitely a work in progress. And this will continue to evolve; mostly to help explain how I envision it. I can see it in my head but may not have expressed it well.</p>
<p>There are definitely some grey areas. Right off the bat, I can think of a couple things that need clarification. How should negative margins be handled? I'm not sure. What should the heights and widths of a box be if the numbers don't add up? I'd suspect more like tables but I don't know the mathematics behind this for current browsers to document this for my spec.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I want  browser developers to integrate Matrix Layouts into the next version of their browsers.  I bring this solution forward in hopes of spreading word, getting feedback, and building momentum.</p>
<p>Let's do this thing.</p>
<h2>Leave a Comment</h2>
<p>As always, I love feedback but at this stage, I'm specifically looking for constructive criticism. Tell me what won't work or what might work better.  If you have any questions, please ask.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, go read the <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/matrix-layouts/">Matrix Layout proposal</a>.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>I love this â€” it feels like it combines all the things we love about positioning, while allowing some of the flexibility that folks miss from the table-layout days, but does it in a way that should make sense even to print designers (since I am one, I can say that ;)</p>
<p>The key is, I'd love to play with it *now* â€” which I can't say for any of the existing ideas/proposals I've seen tossed around over the years. So the question is, are the browser makers and the W3C listening?

		<div class="quote"><p>So would these content areas exhibit table cell behavior within the container matrix? Ie: cells b-f have background images, and cell b extends the furthest vertically in the browser. Cells c-f then extend to match that height? If so, that would be great for some layouts but would be an issue for others (ones that would want the opposite behavior currently inherent in floated elements).</p>
<p>I'll definitely keep an eye on what you're doing. I'd love to be able to vertically align certain content blocks easier, and this looks like it would be a solution.

		<div class="quote"><p>@Dan Rubin: I'm probably going to post a message to www-style to see if I can get some response from them. I worry about the response but we'll see.</p>
<p>@Shane: the elements extend to the bottom of their square. In the example you gave, the background for cell B would extend to the very bottom of the container, as would those for cells C through F. If B has too much content, it will increase the heights of the other columns (just like table-based layouts).

		<div class="quote"><p>It looks like the advanced layout module but without the horrible syntax of making grids in ASCII (that's a compliment by the way)</p>
<p>I'm just thinking how annoying the syntax might be if you need to add a section in dynamically, or how if you've got a slightly different template on one page (i.e. add a row), you have to re-write the entire grid.</p>
<p>I think it's got potential, but maybe putting more editorial work on the grid layout module to incorporate your ideas would be more beneficial (maybe I should have a go!)</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>I like the concept and for this example it totally makes sense.</p>
<p>I'm wondering though, how this works for more complex layouts. Would there be such thing as "nested matrices?" Not that that's necessarily a good idea, but what happens when you create a complex layout and then, sometime in the future, you need to sub-divide a container into multiple containers?</p>
<p>Does the whole matrix need to be rewritten? Or would it just be recommeded to start with a large enough matrix to accomodate future changes? (similar to designing for a 12- or 16-column grid system)

		<div class="quote"><p>@Steve Workman: I did consider that and yes, shifting things around in the matrix would be a minor hassle. I say minor because if you use table-based layouts, it's even worse. And because changing the matrix values on 8 properties would be okay for me; especially since it doesn't happen very often. </p>
<p>This is one of those areas where Advanced Layout is better. I have no issue admitting that. :) But I do want to keep this simple enough to be implemented as soon as possible. </p>
<p>And yes, have a go at improving the grid layout module. Let's get something that browser developers are excited to implement sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>@Zach Leatherman: specify like you would now: ems, px, %. Whatever you want. </p>
<p>@Dan: Yes, you can do nested matrices. Just like you can position absolute in relation to parent absolutes or relatives. (and you can use position absolute/relative within, as well). It's one of the primary reasons I chose it as a value of the position property. It retains the concept that once an element is positioned (ie: not static), it can use different positioning schemes within it.

		<div class="quote"><p>I like where this is going. My only complaint thus far is the syntax within the <code>matrix()</code> call when specifying both pairs. Using a comma to delineate the row and column, in addition to the two row/column pairs, seems awkward. </p>
<p>As there will only be two pairs at most within a <code>matrix()</code> call, why not use a dash between the two?</p>
<pre><code>#a { position: matrix(1,2-1,4); }</code></pre>
<p>That way it would also sound more natural when read aloud: "position as matrix from 1,2 <strong>to</strong> 1,4". Just my two cents.

		<div class="quote"><p>I like it as a means of deciding where in a grid/matrix an element should go, but I think it would benefit from cocoa-esque layout masks properties to define in clear terms how each row and column behaves. I'd also consider a notation for the rows/columns that's a little clearer:</p>
<p>#a {<br />
  position: matrix(1,2-4);<br />
}</p>
<p>which could be the equivalent of your example.

		<div class="quote"><p>@Andrew/Matt: the syntax was done to somewhat mimic how margin and padding shortforms work. In fact, if I had to take any direction, I'd remove commas altogether. like so:</p>
<pre><code>#a { position: matrix(1 1 2 2); }</code></pre>
<p>The reason I didn't was because I felt the commas helped with association. But if everything else looks good, I'm cool with whatever separators. :)

		<div class="quote"><p>@Dan Sorensen: there's two main limitations of current grid systems:</p>
<p>1. You generally have to create deeper div structures to pull off certain grids and have tighter source dependence to rely on. Looser than tables but tighter than Matrix layouts.</p>
<p>2. You can't apply backgrounds that stretch to the height of the container. You have to fake it by applying the background to the parent.

<p>As to having some natural way of saying "take the next spot", if you do a view source, you'll see an "n syntax" documented. It raises a lot of questions as to how that should be handled (which is why I've left it out for now). </p>
<p>90% of the time, layout grids aren't going to use more than 5 elements. 10 at most. If you are going beyond that, I'd start to rethink how you're approaching things. For example, in the grid example I provided above, it could be redone as one matrix for 3 columns and then another matrix within the middle column. </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>I really, really like this concept (and imagine if it were adopted, I'd be inclined to use it on almost all client work I produce.</p>
<p>The things I wonder about:<br />
1. I don't understand the need for <code>width: 50%</code> on element #b in Example 2; doesn't the fact that it explicitly only occupies one column make it 50% (since the other content block is two columns wide)? In general, I find the relative width of the columns to be the hardest part to grasp.<br />
2. At first I disagreed with commas in the syntax, but spaces between values implies "top, right, bottom, left" order. The CSS clip property is an interesting analog.<br />
3. I assume <code>position: matrix</code> elements represent new positioning contexts (so child elements with position: matrix will build a new matrix inside its containing element). The syntax gets a little weird if you have:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;div id="container"&gt;
    &lt;div id="el1"&gt;
        &lt;p id="el2"&gt;Lorem ipsum&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

#container {
	position: relative;
}

#el2 {
	position: matrix(2,1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Infact, that exposes the biggest edge case I can see; what is the width of the (empty) grid column 1 if it's not explicitly set? Am I right in assuming the columns default to evenly spaced, like table cells?</p>
<p>The other issue with the code above; does #el1 default to position: static as normal?</p>
<p>On the plus side, there's nothing that your syntax defines that can't be achieved using tables, am I right? That should allow proof-of-concept code to be written to show the relative value (and ease of development) of your system. Some preprocessor need only read the markup and CSS and map the layout to table cells. The only clear distinction is that a 1x1 element positioned at column 2, row 1 doesn't require an empty table cell (or equivalent).</p>
<p>Fascinating stuff!

<p>I'm not sure that matrix elements themselves should or can determine the overall matrix structure. In some cases you may not have any content to place in the structure but you may need to structure to be equal across pages. </p>
<p>In other words a #secondary element may not be available on all pages but you do want the area to remain empty in case it is available. I wouldn't like to place an empty &lt;div id="secondary"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; just to reserve that column. It looks like that Bert Bos was trying to solve that problem. It just a little complicated. </p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Kit Grose: to answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. if a column is devoid of content, it collapses to a width of 0. Look at Example 5 to see what I mean. Setting the width forces it.</p>
<p>3. Table columns default to evenly spaced only if all of them have exactly the same content or all of them have exactly no content. </p>
<p>In your example, the width of el1 will be the width of container. However, does el1 contain el2 like position:relative, or does it collapse like it does with position:absolute; I think it would collapse. That's definitely something to consider though.</p>
<p>Putting together a system using tables wouldn't actually work. My system is more flexible than that. It would actually have to use position:absolute and work to reposition all items within the grid onload and onresize.

<p>True...again, I'd look to tables, but you're left with two options. Either let it grow to accommodate the content, or have something similar to table-layout: fixed and deal w/ the overflow. </p>
<p>I haven't played with any of the grid based css frameworks, not sure how those handle overflow when things threaten to break the grid.

		<div class="quote"><p>This is a nice approach.<br />
I would simply extend it with two more optional params:<br />
first: parent (default body) to define nested structures<br />
second: collapsable (default no) to define if the cell shall collapse if the content isn't enough to fill the space.<br />
Long forms could be matrix-parent: body; and matrix-cell-collapsable: yes|no;</p>
<p>Therefore you wouldn't need to specify width just to ensure that the cell shows.</p>
<p>The above example would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>
#a { position: matrix(1,2, 1,3); }
#cont { position: matrix(2,2, 2,3); }
#b { position: matrix(1,1 #cont); }
#c { position: matrix(1,2 #cont); }
#d { position: matrix(1,3 #cont); }
#e { position: matrix(1,1, 2,1); }
#f { position: matrix(1,4, 2,4); }</code></pre>
<p>#cont is the container for the cells #b, #c and #d.

		<div class="quote"><p>why don't you separate the grid construction from the boxes? e.g. specify what the grid should look like (defining numbers of rows and columns, their width and height), and then in a separate step define the boxes and padding relative to the grid itself. that way you just have to bother once with grid construction and then just can add boxes as you like, without recalculation each time the width and height of a box.<br />
the grid definition would apply to the parent element (normally the html tag if you define a layout, but could apply also to a div if you want to create a grid-layout inside a div). and that would make sense to me: the parent defines how elements could be positioned inside itself, and the children can decide where to be placed, always sticking to the rules of the parent element.<br />
so you could reuse your grid and place the boxes as you like without having to recalculating width and height.

		<div class="quote"><p>Hasn't the whole DIV stuff completely run out of hand (by now)? Bad design gives bad specs gives bad results !<br />
It seems nobody really can work with it easily regarding the peta-bytes of discussions on the Internet. See how many trouble people have DIV-ing a simple table! As for me I still get confused by 'position', 'float' or whatever DIV style attributes when trying to define a layout.<br />
I've been experimenting with a grid layout implementing a lot of your matrix concept. But it's written in JavaScript and needs some careful impl by the webpage designer.
