	<h1>SnookSurvey #2: To Link or Not?</h1>
		<p>The discussion on this should prove interesting. So, you're ajaxifying an interface and you've got some JavaScript injecting new elements into the DOM for the purpose of enabling interaction. For example, you've got an FAQ with a series of questions and answers. Questions are marked up with H2's (or maybe you prefer definition lists for your FAQ, whatever, this is just for argument's sake). You hide all the answers and set up event handlers for users to click on the questions. But how do you make the interaction obvious? Do you:</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>inject a link element (A) into the HTML and add the event handler to that; or</li>
  <li>add  the event handler to the header and add a class name allowing you to style the header using a different colour and <code>cursor:pointer</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p> Discuss. </p>

Simply because B doesn't degrade for screenreaders or I-dont-use-javascript-because-its-unsafe users :)</p>

Almost every modern screenreader supports javascript at some level (it's true that not every setup with an (old) screenreader supports javascript). Just don't forget to put focus on tne newly available content. (My blind colleague can confim this.)

<p>Preferably constructed in a way, where you insert a url into the href of the &lt;a&gt; as well and put a return false in the javascript.

		<div class="quote"><p>B,<br />
Arguing over which of the two would degrade the best is irrelevant, because they are both being inserted via JS anyway, if JS was turned off neither would ever get added to the page.</p>
<p>In my mind &lt;a&gt; elements are for hyperlinks, not interaction. Given that there is no logical value for the href attribute in this situation, it makes no sense to add an &lt;a&gt; element.

		<div class="quote"><p>A is the only right answer. You should use an anchor because the element is clickable and the right element for clickable items is an anchor, not a H2.</p>
<p>And off course this is more accessible... because screen readers depend on semantic code. But this is just one of the reasons (keyboard nav., search spiders, etc.)

		<div class="quote"><p>Definitely 'a'. I understand why people argue for 'b', but a lot of this doesn't matter, because you're adding the element via JavaScript, so if you do not have JavaScript the code isn't broken, unlike using ::javascript in anchors within 'normal' static code.</p>
<p>The fact that if you didn't use an anchor, you'd have to fix :hover effects for IE6 using JavaScript (OK, you're already using JavaScript, but this is just extra hassle). Definitely 'a'.

		<div class="quote"><p>A - if I had to choose one.</p>
<p>Instead, I'd rather insert a list above the first question which contains all the question titles as anchors which link down to the appropriate part of the page. This is screen-reader and user friendly. The list doesn't really need to be generated by javascript, but it easily could be.

		<div class="quote"><p>Iâ€™ve been giving this some more thought, and decided on this:</p>
<p>B, <strong>unless there is a logical and valid value for the href attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element</strong> eg. anchors, or links to separate pages (â€œjavascript:â€¦â€ is not valid IMO). However in that case, it would probably make more sense to include the &lt;a&gt; element in the mark-up, rather than adding it via JavaScript.

		<div class="quote"><p>Has to be (A), because you want users to be able to keyboard navigate to it.</p>
<p>But, the link could be bogus, with JS to expose the answer text... depending on layout, maybe a class makes sense, but likely just hiding/showing the next child elem should work.

<p>Then again, speaking of this kind of FAQs, IMO the proper way to do it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>two lists
<li>in the first list just the questions
<li>in the second questions and answers
<li>the q's of the first list are links to the q's of the second list, which are anchors
<li>now we have max usablility for UAs without JS
<li>then enhance it with JS:
<ul>
<li>hide the first list</p>
<li>in the second list:
<ul>
<li>hide all answers</p>
<li>give event handler to all question anchors<br />

		<div class="quote"><p>Setting all thoughts of accessibility aside, as we can all agree that the end result needs to be accessible, I'd have to side with (B).</p>
<p>(A) seems to be adding extra markup to the page purely for the sake of taking advantage of that markup's inherent style properties; the extra markup is not really necessary, other than for presentation. Control that presentation with a bit of CSS and lighten that code a bit.</p>
<p>With (A), you'd be adding x number of anchor tags to your page's markup. With (B), you're adding a line or two of CSS (cursor:pointer/hand, maybe a text-decoration:underline).</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>as noted above, it really depends on the way you inject the A tag. If source code remains unchanged and you use JS to inject the extra tags, it's beats the purpose of having it there in the first place - which is to provide better accessibility support. So in that sense, B would be a better/simpler choice.</p>
<p>I however, disagree with Adam's reply above that using the A tag just for the sake of the markup's inherent style properties. Some of the comments mention about keyboard and accessibility support. Also with an A tag, you can implement :hover state without extra javascript (just to make IE6 plays nice). The 'title' attributes provide additional acces. support.

I decided on (B) for my solution previously whilst using definition lists (and only inserting classes, not actual CSS), but I never thought about allowing the ability to set focus.

<p>In a real-world situation, I think Kasimir's two list solution is probably the best method, as it's a little cleaner and less hack-ish than adding an anchor element only to co-opt it's behavior by not actually hyperlinking.

B, because clicking on it doesn't take you to a new page (or an already visible section on the same page), therefore it's not a link.

<p>
I already use B on <a href="http://mikelward.com/links">my links page</a>, but I admit it's lacking something, perhaps something like the expand/collapse widget from the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/">Yahoo UI TreeView</a> would be even better.

<p>
Depending on the size of the content, it may be better to use CSS to hide the answers and use JavaScript to display them.  You can configure the CSS to only hide the answers from screen devices, so screen readers will ignore them and see the whole content.

<p>Roger wants option A just to allow the element to receive focus.  Folks argue this is wrong, as it's not technically a link and doesn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>What about using option B but putting a tabindex on the h2?  This would allow the element to receive focus.  However, you'd need to use another event handler along with the onclick, as onclick won't fire when you hit the enter key, as it does for links. A onkeyup handler that checks which key was pressed might get the job done.

		<div class="quote"><p>I don't see how either of these options can be made accessible. At all.</p>
<p>If the plain page just lists the questions, and the answers are inserted using Javascript, then anyone without Javascript active can't get the answers, full stop. So neither A nor B, in the situation you've suggested.</p>
<p>A better solution would be to have a plain page generated with the answers, and put links to that in the initial plain page. Whether you have a page for each question/answer, or whether you link to, eg, "faq.htm?q=6" and use server-side code to insert the relevant answer into the question page doesn't matter - either way is perfectly accessible.</p>
<p>If you <em>then</em> want to Ajaxify it, you can do. And then, as you've already got [a] tags in your plain page, option <strong>A</strong> makes most sense. It allows non-mouse-users to select and activate the option and to see that it is selected, which is very difficult under B. It doesn't add any additional elements that aren't required by the initial accessible version.</p>
