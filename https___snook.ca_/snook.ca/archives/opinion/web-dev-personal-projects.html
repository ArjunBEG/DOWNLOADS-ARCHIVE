	<h1>A Web Developer's Personal Projects</h1>
		<p>It's interesting to note that many web developers go through a similar process over the course of their careers. One of those rights of passage is the building of a particular application type. Cutting your teeth on building a larger scale application (at least, larger than a contact form that emails somebody and larger than hacking up an install of WordPress) seems to inevitably involve developing a custom application, either as a personal project or as some client deliverable.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I believe that a tried and true web developer should go through this process to understand the pain points of developing larger applications. There are three different types of applications that are certainly great excercises:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The forum</li>
  <li>The blogging engine</li>
  <li>The content management system</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these often has a number of concerns that are always pertinent &mdash; such as user experience design and workflow, authentication, spam handling, email management and certainly database design. </p>
<h2>The Forum</h2>
<p>Over the years, I've built a few forums. Forums can be simple or they can be complex. Software like vBulletin or phpBB have grown to include a massive number of features, most of which are overkill for the average forum. There are certainly some critical design decisions that have to be made such as threaded or inline thread replies, thread notification, thread stickies, and user registration.</p>
<h2>The Blogging Engine</h2>
<p>Forums are probably the least popular application type these days as most people seem to prefer building a blog engine instead&mdash;the similarities of which are interesting. Both have a main topic with the ability for people to respond. The main differences are in who's allowed to post (everybody vs admin) and who's allowed to reply (registered vs anonymous).</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the blogging engine has certainly become one of those things a web developer just does&mdash;usually as a result of outgrowing whatever engine they were using before.</p>
<p>Blogging engines can be much more complex than a forum, though, including   trackbacks and RSS generation. (Not to say that RSS couldn't be in a forum; in fact, it probably should. It's just more prevalent in blogging.) Many web application frameworks like Ruby on Rails, CodeIgniter, and CakePHP include a tutorial on how to build a blog. </p>
<h2>The Content Management System</h2>
<p>The pinnacle project of a web application developer is the custom content management system. Born from the frustrations of trying to wield open source or commercial applications, it seems to be every developer's duty to try and build a custom CMS. How do you manage different object types? Templating, authentication, workflow, internationalization and localization are just a few of the issues you have to contend with in building a CMS. Do you go simple or do you go complex? How does the average user, with little web experience, find their way around the application? </p>
<p>Building a custom CMS is a fantastic excercise on so many levels &mdash; well beyond what you run into with a blog or forum. Much of my design intuitiion came from this type of development. Custom CMS development almost always comes from design issues and not technological issues. They are a response to poor and confusing interfaces. Above and beyond forum design and blog design, CMS design really requires you to step outside of yourself and understand what the pain points are and how to solve them. This might also explain why most of them seem to suck and why developers around the globe continue to feel the need to reinvent this bumpy wheel. </p>
<p>But it's also the avenue with seemingly endless possibilities. Is it hosted, is it custom, is it for the designer, is it for enterprises, and so on and so forth. </p>
<h2>Any others?</h2>
<p>What type of project do you feel is a great way to grow as a developer? As always, comments are open.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>Excellent post Jonathan.  I would add that two other application types that I've developing in the past.  The first is a simple shopping cart and the second is an ad management system or classified ads system.</p>
<p>I think both of these address issues dealing with larger applications as well as issues such as payment management and order status.</p>
<p>Usability is extremely to key to keep in mind when working on these kinds of projects.  A developer should never lose focus of the end user ("don't make me think").

		<div class="quote"><p>Great post Jonathan! James has a good point... e-commerce and ad management systems both play a part in the bigger usability/site integration role that any developer should know beyond forums, blogs and CMS's.</p>
<p>One big exercise, however, is developing an API; Data exchange is proving very important on how the industry evolves. Knowing the ins and outs of authentication, permissions, rate limiting and information access will help anyone grasp a good understanding of how applications work and behave.

		<div class="quote"><p>The forum/blog/cms seems very similar in the fundamental purpose (they are all ways to manage text).  How about a voting system, or a photography system, a social network, or an RSS reader?  And I definitely second the e-commerce system mentioned above.  (Your comment system is awesome btw!  I like the realtime view  :-)

		<div class="quote"><p>Simple shopping cart I can agree with.  I disagree with ad management systems or classified ad system.  It's nothing more than data in, data out.</p>
<p>IMHO, I think some sort of application that relies on scheduling or a release date would be good to have, but that can be mingled in with the CMS system if you really wanted to.</p>
<p>Or, if you really wanted to be cruel, event calendar with the ability to do recurring events. ;)  Just make sure you have a project manager that quotes, "Outlook can do it, why can't you figure this out?"

		<div class="quote"><p>Several years ago I took a try at building a - really - basic blog system. Then I discovered WordPress. For the most part that has worked well since then. But I have been meaning to go back to that project and finish what I started. And go further than planned before.</p>
<p>I've been toying around with some CMS ideas as well, regarding structure and modularity. Haven't gotten any further than that...maybe some day.</p>
<p>I agree that those can be good pet projects to have, to goad us into learning new tools and techniques, and to refine our work.

<p>I have make something different, years ago I create a little turn based web strategy for me and some friend of mine, just for fun :) in my school years. Some of the things I learn there how to do, and most importantly not to do, help me a lot over the years :)

		<div class="quote"><p>I'm kind of working my way backwards through this list.  I've been working on my custom cms for years now.  It's evolved from very simple, to something that is becoming fully-featured, yet with a (hopefully) very intuitive interface.  I'm just now including blogging capabilities into my cms as well.  A forum may come eventually, but not for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do feel like I'm merely re-inventing the wheel, but like you said, it's a bumpy wheel (sometimes it feels more like a hexagon).  I constantly think about giving up on my project and focusing instead on giving wordpress a simplified interface, but then I remember it's not just about the interface.</p>
<p>Anyway, you asked about other projects that a web developer grows through.  I know for me, I grew a lot when I created a simple shoutbox.  It became the basis for my first guestbook, which became the basis for the first version of my cms.  It's amazing how all of these things are related.

<p>Before the forum I built a guestbook, with admin, form and listing. That's the main reason why people started to learn server-side 8-10 years ago.

You'll learn a lot about how core technologies actually work, why most frameworks behave/are structured the way that they do, and it will certainly straighten you out if you are used to writing even slightly sloppy code.

<p>There is no need to drastically change the overall functionality that users expect from your site, as some did when site owners went from Forums to Blogs, as LifeStreams can be easily integrated into pre-existing sites.

		<div class="quote"><p>I believe that the best project for a web developer is one the developer really wants to do, and wants to do well. Something where you say "wouldn't it be cool if..." that you haven't seen done before. This will force you to figure out how to solve a unique problem that hasn't been documented in thousands of places. It certainly helps to know how to roll your own authentication/email/spam system, but, the best developers are the ones that aren't constrained by those conventions.

		<div class="quote"><p>One other functionality which I had to develop with almost every web application I have been working on is a reporting system.<br />
Sometimes they are simple, sometimes they get a bit more complex, but they are always needed if there is any kind of data collection in the application. The most important is to understand which are the relevant data the client need, and to find a way to present the data in readable way for the user.</p>
<p>Navigation in reporting? It can be even more complex than website navigation. Besides a set of navigation menus, I also always use hyperlinks in the reports as a very efficient way to dig deeper through the data.

		<div class="quote"><p>I would definitely agree that developing a CMS is a great exercise, as I tend to prefer developing a mostly new CMS (re-using some components such as user authentication systems) for pretty much every website I make. I prefer to develop a basic CMS that is scoped for a specific site and can be bent any way I choose rather than use a CMS system has too many features that I will never use and is difficult to extend the way I would like. </p>
<p>Usually when I'm testing a new technology (such as Ruby on Rails or Django), I do something a bit more ambitious so that I can learn more than just the technology. An example of this was an Ajax-based multiplayer gaming system I developed to learn Rails (turns out that Ruby makes game logic quite a bit easier).

		<div class="quote"><p>Along with a few others here, while building these applications, I think its a great exercise to extract a framework from the way you develop your applications, if you're not building on top of a framework already.  After time you will either end up with a nice custom little framework of your own, or realize you're building CakePHP, or some other framework, and give in to using whats out there.  Either way its a win situation in my book, you really learn a lot as you try and create a framework.

<p>1) Photo Gallery â€“ something simple, file based, nothing complex.<br />
2) Something to Manipulate graphics using Imagemagik<br />
3) Server Administration console (similar to PHPMyAdmin)<br />
4) Fully fledged Templating system / MVC / WEb Application framework.</p>
<p>I find these are the projects that helped me learn things the best, so far out of all those projects, I've gotten knowledge on: Mysql, Imagemagik, Classes, OOP, Wireframe Design, and a bunch more!

I've already got two CMSes under my belt -- one that manipulated flat files, and one that is database-backed. For the latter, I had to build in basic blog functionality in only a week's time. Stressful, but I think some measure of success was achieved. Feel free to <a href="http://demo.blueinkcms.com/">check it out</a> and see what we've done. It's got some drag-n-drop ajax niceties in an attempt to make things intuitive for most users. Sadly, the company itself is struggling (only 2 guys, after all), but the things I learned give me ample confidence as I forge ahead in this industry.

		<div class="quote"><p>This is very interesting as I recently contemplated the same ideas and thoughts...</p>
<p>Many developers - as they start out - seem to be very interested in building their own small community. This also giving them an exercise in managing flags, database design, user registration and CMS (on a small scale). These projects only live on for so so long until the developer finds that there actually takes a lot of energy to keep it going and soon abandon the project or build it together with a personal page/portfolio.</p>
<p>As also been mentioned in the comments, a voting system and some form of statistics system also seem to be a popular personal project...</p>
<p>Brade; I haven't dug very deep in it, but I find the content (Text primary) to be slightly amateurish although the rest tells a different tale. It gives a kind of mixed feeling even if the system and graphics looks good...

		<div class="quote"><p>The first application I first built was an RSS feed reader in Classic ASP with the ability to do key word searches to help narrow the feeds from places like CNN, BBC, Washington Post, etc. </p>
<p>After that I started building a bunch of other projects over the last year or so, that had been already done by others like bookmarking, contact lists, wine inventory, and a few others again in Classic ASP. </p>
<p>I'm now going to take sometime off work (one week) instead of going to "An Event Apart" in Chicago and build a few of these applications in PHP and MySQL which I don't currently know. This way I have a great deal of time to spend building them and learning the new skills to help improve my resume. I have a lot of the DB design input FORMs already built, just need to do the conversion to the new language and DB. This should make the process a bit easier. </p>
<p>The other big issue I want to do with these applications is make them accessibile and useful on phone web browser.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to have two different friends that said I can use some of their studio space. I know if I stay home to do the work I will end up watching TV, napping, go to the movies, etc.</p>
<p>I have been reading up on both PHP and MySQL and it should be a fun learning experience if nothing else. </p>
<p>Wish me good luck.
