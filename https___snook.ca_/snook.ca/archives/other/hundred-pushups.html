	<h1>Hundred Pushups</h1>
		<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">Hundred Pushups</a>? It's a simple six-week program to build up your strength by slowly increasing the number of pushups you can complete. By the end of six weeks, you should be able to complete 100 and along the way you've gotten a short workout working multiple muscle groups.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/personal/less-of-me">I'm still trying to lose weight</a>, I figured I'd get started on the program (yesterday was my first day and managed to do 12 pushups at the end of my first set). However, being the geek that I am, I thought, &quot;I should track my progress with a cool iPhone app.&quot; There is one available for $1.99 from the Hundred Pushups web site. There is a free web site that can be used to log your progress, too.</p>
<p>I checked out the web application and realized that all it did was track the results of your final set over the course of the six week plan, with the ability to add a comment. Very straightforward. But I want an iPhone app and suddenly inspiration struck...</p>
<h2>Drop and give me two hours</h2>
<p>Last night, I took the challenge to try and put together this application within two hours. Mission accomplished. Almost.</p>
<p><strong><em>Check out <a href="http://pushups.snook.ca/">http://pushups.snook.ca/</a> on your trusty iPhone or iPod Touch.</em></strong></p>
<p>At 11pm last night, I grabbed a copy of <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> and started working out the interface. The documentation needs a little work (need some help, David?) but I managed to figure it out. I used <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/Name-ValueStorage/Name-ValueStorage.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007256-CH6-SW1">localStorage</a> to store the results. You can save the site to your home page where it'll run as a fullscreen application.</p>
<h2>Improvements?</h2>
<p>Of course, there's always room for improvement. Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer 8 and Opera 10.50 has support for localStorage, too, so there's no reason why this can't be adjusted slightly to allow the application to work in desktop browsers, too. I also haven't tested this yet in WebOS or Android and I'd be intrigued to know how well it works.</p>
<p>Some of the interface needs refining, too. I'm using JavaScript-based <code>confirm</code> statements to prevent accidental deletion (like swiping over an entry) but a more iPhone-like experience would be preferred. </p>
<p>If you haven't already, what are you waiting for? Head over to <strong><em><a href="http://pushups.snook.ca/">http://pushups.snook.ca/</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p>I did this challenge before with the little <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/complete.html">printout</a> they offer and it was lame. This makes me want to do again. Added it to my home screen to make sure I get started.

		<div class="quote"><p>Looks great! I started 100 push ups last week. You should check out couch 2 5k (gets you running 5k in 9 weeks, similar to the 100 pushups thing) if you want another keep fit/development challenge - I've been doing it for the last 8 weeks and fell much fitter. (I really sound like bad spam - sorry!)

		<div class="quote"><p>I have the same problem and all my friends in the computer industry have the same problem lack of fiscal activity, lack of sleep, stress... So how do we solve that problem? We hope that 100 Pushups will hack the problem. I tyred the same program and I fail. Why I fail, because I hadn't any fun. Because I was forcing myself to do something that I maybe didn't enjoyed. What will happen after you do 100 pushups? If you don't continue to do pushups(or any other fiscal activity) after the program is over you will #fail. And how can you do something in the long run if you don't have any fun?</p>
<p>@Jonathan: Here is my idea of cool application. Pushups for Fun. The application will not measure how many pushups you made but how much fun you had making them. I think that this is much better aproach.</p>
<p>However making pushups will not resolve anybody problem there are better methods of weight loss. But  you will fell more stronger and confident. And I will leave you with the Latin saying: Mens sana in corpore sano(a healthy mind in a healthy body)</p>

<p>You can see a demo here: http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/dashapp</p>
<p>I have a "quick list" of apps that can be added with a tap (instead of by URL) and I'd like to include yours in this list, perhaps in a screenshot for the app store as well?</p>

<p>Can still use it in Firefox on my desktop, just letting you know.

<p>I did the hundred pushups thing a few times... it's a great way to get going.  My first time through, however, it took me closer to 14 weeks - and I started out at 32 :)</p>
<p>I tweeted my results out whenever I did them and found it to be a source of inspiration for many others.  There was about 30 people doing it and I would chase them down for pushups, haha.</p>
<p>Hope you stick to it!</p>
<p>btw, great idea with the web app - should have thought of that before!

		<div class="quote"><p>I also started playing with jQTouch recently and found the O'Reilly "Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" to be an excellent piece of documentation for jQTouch.  The first few chapters are general iPhone webapp design, the rest of the book is develops a sample application with jQTouch.</p>
<p>It's also available online in the O'Reilly labs:</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@<a href="#c64778">Jake Smith</a>: I've thought about media queries for other projects but probably wouldn't use it in this case. jQTouch can handle orientation changes (iirc).</p>
<p>@<a href="#c64779">Jamie Knight</a>: localStorage can only store string values. Since I want to store the results as a 'bundle', I needed to serialize the object literal and JSON seemed the easiest way to do this. Unfortunately, the iPhone doesn't have native JSON support so I'm using Crockford's JSON parser/stringifier but minified since I don't need readability... I just need the functions. </p>
<p>@<a href="#c64780">Jason J. Gullickson</a>: go right ahead. :)</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>@Jonathan Snook: Most important advice I can give for Hundred Pushups is that you've got to also focus on cardio &amp; endurance.  Otherwise, the pushups get easier but you find it harder to complete the entire set.

		<div class="quote"><p>You know what would be really cool,  while you're doing the pushups you place the iPhone beneath you and have a large button that you touch with your nose and it counts your pushups. Touch interface at it's best. Seriously you should add that.
