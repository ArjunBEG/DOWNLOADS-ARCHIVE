	<h1>Track Comments with Co.mments</h1>
		<p><img width="260" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="38" align="middle" src="https://snook.ca/files/image/comments.gif" alt="Co.mments" /></p>
<p>I've been using for months now and <a href="http://co.mments.com/">Co.mments</a> is by far my favourite way to track comments on a site.</p>
<p>How does it work? Through the use of a bookmarklet, I just hit a button on a page whose comments I wish to track. It doesn't matter if the site uses WordPress, Movable Type or a custom home-grown solution. And you don't have to leave a comment in order to continually track the page.</p>
<p>Even better, you don't even have to create an account to use it. It'll remember the sites you're tracking through the use of a cookie. If you do create an account then you have them safely stored if something happens to your cookie or if you want to access your account from another browser or computer.</p>
<p>When tracking sites, it'll ping and update with the number of new comments. You can even read the new comments right from Co.mments without having to return to the site. With that said, it's not perfect. It must have some algorithm for determing comments on a page and certain HTML structures prevent it from pulling out comment text or updating the number of new comments. The accuracy, in my opinion, is still really good, though. Probably around 95%.</p>
<p>For those blogs that don't get tracked properly, at least I have a central place to keep an eye on articles that I wish to check back on.</p>
<p>After the discussion has died down and I'm no longer interested in tracking the page, I simply remove it from the list.</p>
<p>If you need a handy way to track conversations,  I recommend you head on over to <a href="http://co.mments.com/">Co.mments.com</a> and give it a try.</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>coComment (http://www.cocomment.com/) does much the same thing. It's slightly prettier though and there it has a community feel to it, what with "Top Commenters" and favourites and such.<br />
It's funny how they have such similar things. I mean, I understand why the emphasis on the word "comment," but even still ...

		<div class="quote"><p>I had looked at coComment when it was first released and it was limited at the time. It looks like they've expanded the feature set to include much of what co.mments does. Just playing with it now, I like the interface of coComment but I find the interface slow to load (at least through the bookmarklet...the firefox add-on is probably faster). co.mments does have the added bonus that you don't have to signup or login. Definitely pros and cons between them. I might have to give coComment another go.

		<div class="quote"><p>Last I checked, both services have a hell of a time picking out comments on non-standard templates. I wrote up an algorithm and sent it to the cocomment folks, but they don't seem to have progressed any farther.</p>
<p>I'm getting sick of cocomment. Their javascript is super slow, and the extension bogs firefox down horribly. Don't use it.

		<div class="quote"><p>I have been <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/clagnut">using coComment</a> for a while, and I've enabled it on my (homemade) blog engine. Although I have signed up (to keep a central record of my comments), I think you can still do the cookie-based commenting. I liked coComment because it also provided an API so I could extract my comments and track them elsewhere.

And this is a prime example: if somebody did manage to get access to the cookies for this site, they'd manage to get a client_id which might allow them to view the articles I'm tracking. That's information I'd readily share. Do some further research before you paint cookies in such a bad light.

		<div class="quote"><p>Having tried cocomment, commentful and co.mments, I've settled for co.mments. I love its simplicity. Plus in my tests it handled more blogs than the other two services, but your milleage might vary (furthermore it was months ago).<br />
The only downside of co.mments is that it's the "smallest" one of the three, hence its reliability and availability might not be the best. For instance a few weeks ago a problem with the server resulted in a pruning of old conversations. I lost about 2/3 of my conversations. Although those had died for lack of new comments I kept them in my list as some kind of history. I was sad when they disappeared. :(

		<div class="quote"><p>If your a coComments user as well as a Firefox user, the coComments plugin for Firefox is excellent. It's been around since approx August last year so it's quite stable and functional.</p>
<p>Well worth installing my 497th Firefox Plugin. (Joke but it feels that way with the sheer number of neat Firefox extensions available)</p>

		<div class="quote"><p>This is kind of a sore subject for me.  Back in the day, I was happy with co.mment.  It did the purpose it was intended to do, but as I started to track more comments I desired more features. </p>
<p>1. When I click the bookmarklet it should clear the RSS feed (why do I want to be notified about comments I have already made?</p>
<p>2. co.mments did a horrific job of picking up feeds on anything other than a blog.  For instance, trying to get it to detect a feed on the WordPress forum (which is RSS enabled) never worked.</p>
<p>These two things were big enough to make me look again at coComment which, like you, I was not impressed with in the beginning.  The Firefox plugin is ok, but it does add some load time to pages.  It did provide a feed that did not post comments I've already read.</p>
<p>The big thing is how horrific the coComment interface is.  They recently changed it, and I think it actually got worse.  It was looking good, but then it went downhill.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had conversations with Assaf of co.mments, and it seems as though he's stopped doing development on the app (as the co.mments blog suggests).  Sore, sore subject.
