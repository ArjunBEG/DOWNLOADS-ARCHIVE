# Get Started Tutorial: A single-page web app + REST API - Sample Code

This is the complete sample code for the [Get Started Tutorial: A single-page web app + REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/get-started-tutorial-fullstack-web-app) on [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows).

This 2-part sample uses popular fullstack web technologies to run a simple *Memory* game that both works in the browser and as a Hosted Web App for the Microsoft Store.

The [backend](backend/README.md) folder demonstrates a simple REST API service for the cloud-hostable game logic, such that game state is preserved when playing across different devices.

The [frontend](frontend/README.md) folder  demonstrates a single-page web application with responsive layout for the game itself.
