# REST API sample (Memory Game API)

This is the complete code for Part I of  [Get Started Tutorial: A single-page web app + REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/get-started-tutorial-fullstack-web-app). This code demonstrates the game logic for a simple game of *Memory* (also known as [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game))) using a cloud-hostable REST API service.

## Requirements:

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Be sure to select the option to add Node to your PATH.

## To run the sample:

 1. Copy down this folder and open your favorite shell to it.

 2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
 
 3. Run `npm start` to start the Node server.

 4. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), which provides a [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) that documents the operations provided by the Memory Game API and provides a manual testing interface.
