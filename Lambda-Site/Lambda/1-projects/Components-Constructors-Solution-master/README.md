**COMPONENTS-CONSTURCTORS**
----------------------------------

Topics:
* Naming Conventions
* BEM
* Constructors with ES6 class syntax

You will be building on your prior work from Components-BEM by adding a `Tabs` component.

The HTML and CSS for the Tabs component and instance are provided so that you may add your prior work around it. If you have not finished Components-BEM, ask you TA for the solution.

You may need to adjust some of the naming for the usuage of `Box` in the HTML provided if it's different in your implementation.

## Description
  The `Tabs` component should be a grouping of links and associated items. Only one item is shown at a time, and each item is shown when its corresponding link is clicked. You should default to the first link and item upon page load.

  You will also be doing a more complex query with `querySelector` and Data Attributes. It's a great challenge to try to work out on your own. If it's holding you back too much, you may ask your TA for the solution to that query.
