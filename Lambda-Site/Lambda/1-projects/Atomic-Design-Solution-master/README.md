# Client Side Routing - HTTP - Atomic Design

## Topics
  * Routing with React Router
  * Axios for making HTTP requests
  * JavaScript Promises
  * Atomic Design

## Description
In this `create-react-app` initialized app, you will be working with the provided UI library, which has been developed based on `Atomic Design` principles. This is not the only way to design and organize your components, but it will serve as an example of a very strong option.

The app you will be finishing is an app that lists a few dog breeds, shows an image, and provides links to view their sub-breeds.

## Instructions
You are given the `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, and `templates` needed to build out this app. You will just need to consume them in your pages `Breeds.js` and `SubBreeds.js`. All of your HTTP requests should be made from inside of the page files.

* Requirements for `Breeds.js`
  * Title should be "Breeds"
  * Show a list of dog breeds
  * Each list item should be a link to a `SubBreed` page that shows the sub-breed details
  * Show an image of the first dog breed in the list, with that breed as a title for the image
  * use the provided method `filterBreeds` or any modification of it to limit the list (This is to make sure that the breeds we show actually have sub-breeds. Make sure you still make the initial get requests for the list of dogs first though as part of the assignment exercise)

* Requirements for `SubBreeds.js`
  * Title should be "Sub-breeds"
  * Subtitle should be the given breed
  * Show a list of sub-breeds for the given breed
  * Show an image of the first sub-breed in the list, with that sub-breed as a title for the image
