# Closures, Callbacks and Array Methods

This challenge focuses on closures, callbacks and array methods.

You are encouraged to use the [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) as well as Google, to figure things out.

Use Google effectively! For example, let's say you want to learn more about the `reduce` array method. Here are some Google searches you could try:
```
  mdn array reduce
```
```
  array.prototype.reduce
```
```
  reduce site:mozilla.org
```
```
  javascript reduce site:stackoverflow.com
```

Commit often! **Plan to commit & push every time you get a new test passing**. This makes it SO much easier to figure out "what broke my code", and helps your TL keep track of how you're doing.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Get Started](#get-started)

## Instructions

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your tests are passing. One of the tests corresponds to a stretch task! Attempt the stretch task only after completing all other tasks.

## Get Started

<summary><strong>Using VSCode and a Command Line:</strong></summary>

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
1. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
1. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
1. Install dependencies by typing `npm install`
1. Run tests by typing `npm run test:watch`
1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual
