# Basic JavaScript + ES6
* ES6 
* Const vs Let vs Var
* Lambda/Arrow functions
* Object Destructuring 

### Project Description
* This project should be very familiar to you. You have already suffered through the logic behind a lot of these expressions/functions. 
* We're excited to give you something you've already worked on, but to now just convert the code into ES6 syntax. 
* Learning to program is all about repetition. So teaching you a new concept with material that you've already learned will help you solidify the material and also teach you new concepts along the way.
* Project files 1 - 3 are all that need to be completed for this assignment. And Project-4 is *Extra Credit*. 
* Please have fun!
