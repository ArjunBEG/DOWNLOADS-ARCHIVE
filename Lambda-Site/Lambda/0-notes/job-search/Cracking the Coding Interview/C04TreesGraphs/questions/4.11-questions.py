# 4.11 Random Node

# You are implementing a binary search tree class from scratch which, in addition to 
    # insert, find, and delete, has a method, getRandomNode(), which returns a random
    # node from the tree.
# All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.
# Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement
    # the rest of the methods.
