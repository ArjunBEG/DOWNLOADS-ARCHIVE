# 4.10 Check Subtree

# T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much > T2. 
# Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.
# A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node in T1 such that 
    # the subtree of n is identical to T2.
# That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
