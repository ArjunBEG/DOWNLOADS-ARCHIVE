# 5.8 Draw Line

# A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
    # pixels to be stored in one byte.

# The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8.
# That is, no byte will be split across rows.

# The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
    # and the width.

# Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).

# The method signature should look something like:
    # drawline(bite[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
