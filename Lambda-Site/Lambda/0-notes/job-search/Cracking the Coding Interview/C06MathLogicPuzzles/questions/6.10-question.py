# 6.10 Poison

# You have 100 bottles of soda and exactly one is poisoned.
# You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison.
# A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently.
# You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a 
    # test strip as many times as you'd like as long as the results are negative.
# However, you can only run tests once per day.
# It takes 7 days to return a result.
# How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

# FOLLOW UP:  Write code to simulate your approach.
