# 6.6 Blue-Eyed Island

# A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order:
    # all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible.

# There will be a flight out at 8:00 p.m. every evening.
# Each person can see everyone else's eye color.
# They do not know their own nor is anyone allowed to tell them.
# Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know at least one person does.

# How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?
