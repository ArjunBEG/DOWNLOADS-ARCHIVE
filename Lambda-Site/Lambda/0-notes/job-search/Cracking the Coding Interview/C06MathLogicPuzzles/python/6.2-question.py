# 6.2 Basketball

# You have a basketball hoop and someone says you can play 1 of 2 games.
# Game 1:  You get 1 shot to make the hoop.
# Game 2:  You get 3 shots and you have to make 2 of 3 shots.
# If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of 
    # p should you pick one game or the other?

# Game 1:  Probability of winning:  p
# Game 2:  Probability of winning:  3p^2-2p^3

# p > 0.5 & < 1 = Game 2
# p > 0 & < 0.5 = Game 1
# 0, 0.5, 1 same chances
