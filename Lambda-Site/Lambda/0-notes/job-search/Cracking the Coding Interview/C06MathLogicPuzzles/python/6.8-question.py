# 6.8 The Egg Drop Problem

# There is a building of 100 floors.  
# If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break.
# If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.
# You're given two eggs.  
# Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

# start at the bottom, drop egg on each floor until it breaks, N-1 from there.
