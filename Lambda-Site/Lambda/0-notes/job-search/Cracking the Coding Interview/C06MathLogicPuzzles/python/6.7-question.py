# 6.7 The Apocalypse

# In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate.

# Therefore, she decrees that all families abide by this policy.
# That is, they have to continue to have children until they have 1 girl, at which point they immediately stop.
# What will the gender ratio of the new generation be?

# Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or girl on any given pregnancy is equal.
# Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

# will always be 50% because the odds of having boy/girl is equal
