# The Heavy Pill

# You have 20 bottles of pills.
# 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.
# Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
# You can only use the scale once.

# put all the bottles on the scale.  Remove them one by one.  When the scale goes down by 1.1, you found it.
