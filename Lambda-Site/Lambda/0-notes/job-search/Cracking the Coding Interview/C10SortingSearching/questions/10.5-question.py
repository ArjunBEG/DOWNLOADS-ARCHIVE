# Sparse Search

# Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, 
    # write a method to find the location of a given string.

# EXAMPLE:  INPUT:  ball, {"at", "", "", "", "ball", "", "", "car", "", "", "dad", "", ""}
         # OUTPUT:  4

# time complexity:  O()
# space complexity:  O()
