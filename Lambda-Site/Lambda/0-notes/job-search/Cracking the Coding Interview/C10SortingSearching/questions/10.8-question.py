# Find Duplicates

# You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to n, where n is at most 32k.
# The array may hv duplicate entries and you do not know what n is.
# With only 4kb of memory available, how would you print all duplicate 
    # elements in the array?


# time complexity:  O()
# space complexity:  O()
