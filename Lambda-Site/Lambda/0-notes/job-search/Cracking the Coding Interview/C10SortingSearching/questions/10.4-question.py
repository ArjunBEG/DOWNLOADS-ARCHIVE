# Sorted Search, No Size

# You are given an array-like data structure Listy, which lacks a size method.
# It does, however, have an elementA(i) method that returns the element at 
    # index i in O(1) time.
# If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1.
# For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.
# Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index 
    # at which an element x occurs.
# If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

# time complexity:  O()
# space complexity:  O()
