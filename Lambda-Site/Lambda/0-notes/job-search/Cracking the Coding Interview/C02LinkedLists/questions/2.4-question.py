# Partition

#  Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to xpygame.examples.aliens.main()
# IMPORTANT:  The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition". 
    # It does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
    # The additional spacing in the example below indicates the partition.

# INPUT:  3 --> 5 --> 8 --> 5 --> 10 --> 2 --> 1 [partition=5]
# OUTPUT:  3 --> 1 --> 2     -->     10 --> 5 --> 5 --> 8
