# 2.5 Sum Lists:

# You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
# The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1s digit is at the head of the list.
# Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
# You are not allowed to "cheat" and just convert the linked list to an integer.
# INPUT:  (7 --> 1 --> 6) + (5 --> 9 --> 2).  That is, 617 + 295.
# OUTPUT:  9 --> 1 --> 2; that is, 912.

# FOLLOW UP:  Suppose the digits are stored in forward order.  Repeat the above problem.
# INPUT:  (6 --> 1 --> 7) + (2 --> 9 --> 5).  That is, 617 + 295.
# OUTPUT:  9 --> 1 --> 2; that is, 912.
