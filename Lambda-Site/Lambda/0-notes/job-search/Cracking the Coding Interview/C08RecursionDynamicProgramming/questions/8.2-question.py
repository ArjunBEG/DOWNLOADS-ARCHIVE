# 8.2 Robot in a Grid

# Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner off grid with r rows and c columns.
# The robot can only move in 2 directions, right and down.
# Certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them.
# Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
