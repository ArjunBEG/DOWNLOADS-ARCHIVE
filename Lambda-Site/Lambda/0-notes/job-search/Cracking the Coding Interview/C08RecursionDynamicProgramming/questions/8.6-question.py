# 8.6 Towers of Hanoi

# In the classic problem of Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of dfifferent sizes which can slide onto any tower.
# The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order off size from top to bottom.
# I.E. each disk sits on top of an even larger one.

# You have the following constraints:
    # Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    # A disk is slid offf the top off one tower onto another tower.
    # A disk cannot be placed on top off a smaller disk.

# Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
