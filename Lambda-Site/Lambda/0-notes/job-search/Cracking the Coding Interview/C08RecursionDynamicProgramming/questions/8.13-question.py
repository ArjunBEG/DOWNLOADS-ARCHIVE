# 8.13 Stack of Boxes

# You have a stack of n boxes with widths w, heights h, and depths d.
# The boxes cannot be rotated.
# They can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is 
    # strictly larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth.
# Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack.
# The height off a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
