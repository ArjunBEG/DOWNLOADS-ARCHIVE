# Cache

# Imagine a web server for a simplified search engine.
# This system has 100 machines to respond to search queries, which may then call
    # out using processSearch(string query) to another cluster of machines to 
    # actually get the result.
# The machine which responds to a given query is chosen at random, so you cannot 
    # guarantee that the same machine will always respond to the same request.
# The method processSearch is very expensive.
# Design a caching mechanism for the most recent queries.
# Be sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.

# time complexity:  O()
# space complexity:  O()
