# Stock Data

# Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1k client
    # apps to get simple end-of-day stock price info (open, close, high, low).  
# You may assume you already have the data.
# You can store it in any format you wish.

# How would you design the client-facing service that provides the info to client apps?
# You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring, and maintenance
    # of the feed.
# Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your approach.
# Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can distribute the info to the client apps 
    # in any mechanism you choose.
