# 3.6 Animal Shelter

# An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly FIFO basis.  
# People must adopt either the "oldest", based on arrival time, of all animals at the shelter OR
    # they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat.  
    # They will receive the oldest animal off that type.
# They cannot select which specific animal they would like. 
# Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as:
    # enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, dequeueCat
# You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
