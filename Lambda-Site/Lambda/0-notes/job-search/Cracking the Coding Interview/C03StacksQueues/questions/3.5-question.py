# 3.5 Sort Stack

# Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on top.  
# You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into 
    # any other data structure such as an array.
# The stack supports the following operations:  push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
