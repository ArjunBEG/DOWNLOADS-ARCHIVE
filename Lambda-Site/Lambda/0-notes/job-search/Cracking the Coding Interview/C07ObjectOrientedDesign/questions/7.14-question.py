6. Design a Hotel Management System

Youâ€™ll want to make sure you cover:

Room Complexity: How will the system support different room types within the same hotel?
Alerts: How will the system remind users that their check-in date is approaching? What other alerts might be useful to factor in?
Customization: How would users make special requests on their room? What kind of special requests would be supported?
Cancellation / Modification: How would the system treat booking cancellation (within the allowed time period)? What about other changes? What types of modifications would be covered?
