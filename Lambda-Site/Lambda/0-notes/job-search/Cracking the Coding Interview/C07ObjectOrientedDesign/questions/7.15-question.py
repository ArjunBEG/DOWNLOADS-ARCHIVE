8. Design an Online Stock Brokerage System

A good answer would cover these points:

Watchlists: How would the system handle watchlists created by the user to save/monitor specific stocks?
Transaction Types: How would the system handle different transaction types, e.g. stop loss and stop limit order? What types would be supported?
Stock Lots: How will the system differentiate between different ‘lots’ of the same stock for reporting purposes if a user has bought the same stock multiple times?
Reporting: How will the system generate reports for monthly, quarterly, and annual updates?
