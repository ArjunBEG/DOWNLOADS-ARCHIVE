4. Design an Airline Management System

A good answer from an interviewer’s perspective would address:

Itinerary Complexity: How would multi-flight itineraries work? How would multiple passengers on the same itinerary be handled?
Alerts: How are customers notified if there’s a change to the flight status?
External Access: How would the system interact with other actors making reservations to the same flights, such as a front-desk operator for an airline?
