Design Amazon / Flipkart (an online shopping platform)

Beyond the basic functionality (signup, login etc.), interviewers will be looking for the following:

Discoverability: How will the buyer discover a product? How will the search surface results?
Cart & Checkout: Users expect the cart and checkout to behave in a certain way. How will the design adhere to such known best practices while also introducing innovative checkout semantics like One-Click-Purchase?
Payment Methods: Users can pay using credit cards, gift cards, etc. How will the payment method work with the checkout process?
Product Reviews & Ratings: When can a user post a review and a rating? How are useful reviews tracked and less useful reviews de-prioritized?
