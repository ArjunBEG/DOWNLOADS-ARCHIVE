3. Design an ATM

Interviewers would want to see you discuss things like:

Overdrawing: What would you do when the ATM doesnâ€™t have any cash left?
Pin Verification: What if a user enters a wrong PIN multiple times?
Card Reading: How would you detect if the card has been correctly inserted or not?
