Discoverability: How are users able to search other users’ profiles?
Following: How are users able to follow/unfollow other users without becoming a direct connection?
Groups / Pages: How are members able to create both groups and pages in addition to their own user profiles?
Privacy: How will the system handle privacy lists with certain content to be displayed only to specified connections?
