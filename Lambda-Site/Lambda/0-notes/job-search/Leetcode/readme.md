# Notes About Leetcode/Interview Prep

## Tips

* You don't need to complete all 3.
* I got 3 Qs to complete in 1 hour.
* I was able to give solutions to 2 of them.
* I had to use Eclipse to debug and ensure the tests passed.
* For the third one, I mentioned the approach, that too a brute force approach, and got invited to on-site.
* Giving time/space complexities in comments and a 2 to 3 line explanation is also expected.

## Puzzle

Given an 8-pint jug full of water and two empty jugs of 5- and 3-pint capacity, get exactly 4 pints of water in one of the jugs by completely filling up and/or emptying jugs into others?

* pour from 8 to 5 (3 in 8, 5 in 5, 0 in 3)
* pour from 5 to 3 (3 in 8, 2 in 5, 3 in 3)
* pour from 3 to 8 (6 in 8, 2 in 5, 0 in 3)
* pour from 5 to 3 (6 in 8, 0 in 5, 2 in 3)
* pour from 8 to 5 (1 in 8, 5 in 5, 2 in 3)
* pour from 5 to 3 (1 in 8, 4 in 5, 3 in 3)
* pour from 3 to 8 (4 in 8, 4 in 5, 0 in 3)
