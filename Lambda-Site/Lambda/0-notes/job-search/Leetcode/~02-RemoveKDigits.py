# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number 
    # so that the new number is the smallest possible.

# NOTE:  The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
# NOTE:  The given num does not contain any leading zero.

'''
Example 1:
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3   |   Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 
    to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
'''
'''
Example 2:
Input: num = "10200", k = 1   |   Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. 
Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
'''
'''
Example 3:
Input: num = "10", k = 2   |   Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
