# Max Inserts to Obtain String Without 3 Consecutive 'a'

# Write a function solution that, given a string S 
    # consisting of N characters, returns the maximum 
    # number of letters 'a' that can be inserted into 
    # S (including at the front and end of S) so that 
    # the resulting string doesn't contain 3 consecutive 
    # letters 'a'. 
    
# If string S already contains the substring "aaa", then 
    # your function should return -1.

'''
Examples:
1. Given S = "aabab", the function should return 3, 
    because a string "aabaabaa" can be made.
2. Given S = "dog", the function should return 8, 
    because a string "aadaaoaagaa" can be made.
3. Given S = "aa", the function should return 0, 
    because no longer string can be made.
4. Given S= "baaaa", the function should return -1, 
    because there is a substring "aaa".
