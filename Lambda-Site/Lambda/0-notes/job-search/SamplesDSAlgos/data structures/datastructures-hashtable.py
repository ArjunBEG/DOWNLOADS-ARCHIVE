# HASH TABLE
    # array with elements indexed by hashed key
    # associative arrays and dictionaries
    # objects
    # caches (memcached)
    # dynamic programming, memoization
    # send key through hashing function (MD5, SHA1, etc.), which converts to addressable space (index)
    # powerful for maps because now our key points to where our object is being stored
    # powerful for sets because we can check where if anything exists at that memory address and, if 
        # so, then it exists; if not, then key is not in set
    # no look-up cost when deleting or adding
    # not useful for something with an order
    # need sufficiently large amount of memory to store all objects without collisions
        # can balloon quickly
    # need good hashing algorithm that spits out viable table address
    # needs several qualities:
        # idempotent (critical), good distribution of values, performant

    # key/value data storage & retrieval
        # data stored as array
        # key converted to integer via hash functino
        # hashed key converted to array index via modulo function

# hash function:  one-way mapping from arbitrary data to fixed data size & type
    # different hash functions with different attributes:
        # deterministic
        # uniform distribution
        # non-invertible
        # continuous versus non-continuous
# hash-table collision:  when two keys hash to same index
    # collisions are unavoidable
    # open addressing & linked-list chaining to avoid collisions
# linked-list chaining:  elements in hash table are stored as linked lists
    # when retrieving a value, traverse down linked list until you find matching key
# hash-table resizing:  can occur when load factor passes certain threshhold
    # create new hash table with double capacity
    # copy elements from old to new one at a time
    # resizing = O(n) & occurs at O(log (n)) frequency
# load factor:  number of entries / hash-table capacity

# time complexity:   Avg   |   Worst
    # Access:       N/A    |   N/A
    # Search:       O(1)   |   O(n)
    # Insertion:    O(1)   |   O(n)
    # Deletion:     O(1)   |   O(n)

# space complexity:  O(n)
