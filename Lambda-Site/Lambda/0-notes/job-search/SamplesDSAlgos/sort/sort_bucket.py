How do we sort the numbers efficiently?

    A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm. 
    The lower bound for comparison-based sorting algorithm (merge, heap, quick,
        etc.) is Î©(n Log n), can't do better than n log n.

Count sort can't be used as we use keys as index in count sort. 
Here keys are floating point numbers.

# BUCKET SORT

    # mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
    # buckets created to put elements into
        # number of elements = number of buckets
    # apply insertion sort to each bucket
    # concatenate buckets to get sorted array

# time complexity:  Best O(n+k)   |   Avg O(n+k)   |   Worst O(n^2)
# space complexity:  O(n)
