# Are you ready for the DS&A interview?

Taken from [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hasankhan_here-is-how-we-can-evaluate-ourselves-if-activity-6697548483714527232-GfU1); author deletes all posts after five days, so it may not be available at the time you read this.

1. Do I understand the basic algorithms and data structures well enough to be able to explain it to someone else?  See https://lnkd.in/dx_m4Sa for a list of most common ones.

2. Can I code these data structures and algorithms quickly and completely from memory?  e.g. Can I write quicksort or merge sort right now? Can I implement DFS both iteratively and recursively right now?  Just practice writing it repeatedly saves it in our muscle memory.

3. Can I easily calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm?

4. Can I solve a DS&A problem in 30-40 minutes by taking 10-15 minutes maximum in coming up with a solution, 15-20 minutes in coding it, and remaining time in testing it?

5. Can I dry-run code to prove that it is correct?
