## Object Oriented Design Questions

In Object Oriented Design questions, interviewers are looking for your understanding of the nuances of complex problems and your ability to transform the requirements into comprehensible Classes.

In fact, OOD questions generally will all follow a very similar pattern. You will be provided with a vague problem and a set of constraints for a system to design, and very little else. It is then up to you, the candidate, to figure out the “level” of solution that the interviewer is looking for, what kind of functionality will be needed, and come up with a workable solution.

Interviewers are looking for one main thing: finding the right balance between a solution that works immediately and is also adaptable to change in the future.

To simplify things, you can take the following approach for any OOD question you encounter:

## Clarify the requirements

Make sure you understand the expectations of the interviewer. Ask clarifying questions if at all necessary — the interviewer will not mind, and will likely appreciate it. For example, “are you looking for me to demonstrate the structure of a solution, or to fully implement it?” Doing this here will take about 5–10 seconds, but save tremendous amounts of time later.

## Hash out the primary use cases

Think about, and then talk through, use cases. Make sure you understand all the different functionality your system is expected to have. Talking about it out loud can also help you to come across expectations or ideas you might not have realized if you just jumped right in.

## Identify key Objects

Now, identify all the objects that will play a role in your solution. For example, if you’re designing a parking lot, these will be things like vehicles, parking spots, parking garages, entrances, exits, garage operators, etc.

## Identify Operations supported by Objects

Work out all the behaviors you’d expect each object that you identified in the previous step to have. For example, a car should be able to move, park in a given spot, and hold a license plate. A parking spot should be able to accommodate a two-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle — and so on.


## Identify Interactions between Objects

Map out the relationships between the different objects that will need to interface with each other. This is where it all comes together. For example, a car should be able to park in a parking spot. Parking garages should be able to fit multiple parking spots, and so on.
