## Important

For security reasons, in a real world application, passwords and secrets should not be stored in config files. Instead, consider securing your credentials with an application such as Key Vault.

## Troubleshoot

Windows shows "File path too long" during Eclipse IDE setup extraction.

> Skip the files during extraction whose paths are too long

Windows shows error popup while trying to run the *eclipse.exe* file.

> Check the size of the extracted Eclipse setup folder. It should be ~599 MB.

Eclipse shows "Building has encountered a problem" or "Maven is not configured properly" error after importing the project.

> 1. Delete folder named 2.6 from __%userprofile%\\.m2\repository\org\apache\maven\plugins\maven-resources-plugin\\__ directory
> 2. Right click project's name from Project Explorer > Maven > Update Project > Check Force Update of Snapshots/Releases > Click Ok

Eclipse shows "The server cannot be started because one or more of the ports are invalid. Open the server editor and correct the invalid ports." error while starting the Tomcat server.

> 1. Click on Servers tab on the event log area of the IDE
> 2. Double click on the server name which says "Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost..."
> 3. Set the Tomcat admin port to any available port (for e.g. 8079)

"Run on Server" option is not visible for running the project.
