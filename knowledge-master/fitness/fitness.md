# Fitness

I try to do some daily bodyweight exercises in form of sit-ups & pushups and cardio in form of running or cycling.

My preferred way to exercise is to play Tennis.

I also listen to [podcasts](../podcasts/podcasts.md) unless it's some team sport like football.

I try to not sit for prolonged times (by using a standing desk or taking breaks).

## Notes

- Exercise helps make better use of the foods you are eating and produces the hormones you need to think clearly.
- [It's been shown that the timing of your meals and more specifically your protein intake, doesn't make any difference to the growth of your muscles. Just get adequate protein and calories throughout the day, though you might want to eat something post workout anyway for energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/9fxkof/if_you_eat_a_big_preworkout_meal_do_you_need_to/)
- [Massive calorie surplus isn't making you put on muscle any faster and is just being turned into fat. And that makes sense. There is only so much muscle you can actually build naturally every week/month/year. Extra calories beyond what will be used for that muscle growth aren't going to increase that limit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ed6kbi/thoughts_on_greg_doucette_and_his_opinion_on/)
- [If you want a correlation between sitting at a desk and building strength to offset that, look at squats in all it's forms, and hamstring and quad dominant exercises. Your lower body is in much more trouble than your lower back from sitting at a computer. Hipflexer stretches with resistance bands will also do you wonders.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25030938)
- [Exercise is good for you, and what that exercise looks like is almost completely unimportant. Do what you enjoy and can sustain. If you have ten minutes in the morning, do HIIT. If you have an hour after work and want to get out of the house, go jogging or ride a bike. Anything is better than nothing.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25071676)
