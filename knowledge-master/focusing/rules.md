## Ask questions

- When posting an error or an issue, [give as much relevant information](../research/asking-questions.md) as I can to help debug it.

## Track

- Track everything worth tracking (lists of movies seen, books read, series watched..).

## Travel

- Mark [places I've liked](https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/1t_jW3zR93T4wMQCQPo1aBbcS61A) in Google Maps with optional notes about them.

## Karabiner

- Sort bindings in the order of keyboard (Q -> W -> E ..). Spacebar is always last key.

## Naming

- Twitter/Reddit/Instagram/GitHub, get literal name if available. On Twitter, lowercasing the name looks good (Twitter will show your custom real name in searches already). Can [capitalize](https://twitter.com/khanacademyeng) username if its multiple words (can rename username if needed). Capitalize [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApolloApp/) subreddit name as it stands out better in searches & its more recognizable (the name can't be changed later so capitalize even if one word). GitHub is good [lowercased](https://github.com/learn-anything), literal name or with dashes. If name is taken, can add `_` or [HQ](https://twitter.com/SlackHQ)/[App](https://twitter.com/SparkMailApp)/[Inc](https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc) in the end or prefix with [get](https://twitter.com/getairbridge) or [use](https://twitter.com/usefathom). For Instagram, if literal name is taken, it's possible to get domain name literal like [narative.co](https://www.instagram.com/narative.co/). Can use [namecheckr](https://www.namecheckr.com/) to check for available names.
- For domains, get literal name, avoid dashes. Keep it to one registrar (Google Domains preferred). Prefer `.com`, ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)), `.co` ([vsco.co](https://vsco.co/)) or `.io` ([codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)) for generic sites. If it's an app, can use `.app` ([linear.app](https://linear.app)), can also have app in name like [feyapp.com](https://feyapp.com) if `.app` is taken. Developer related, `.dev` ([web.dev](https://web.dev)) is good. Organization, then `.org.` ([telegram.org](https://telegram.org/)). ML related, `.ai` ([deepcode.ai](https://www.deepcode.ai/)) can be good. Design related, `.design` is good ([baseweb.design](https://baseweb.design/)). Video related, `.tv` is good ([rewatch.tv](https://rewatch.tv/)). Otherwise, `.so`, ([notion.so](https://www.notion.so/)), `.xyz` ([learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz)), `.sh` ([apex.sh](https://apex.sh/)) are good. Can also play on domain name like [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) if possible. Make domain name memorable.
