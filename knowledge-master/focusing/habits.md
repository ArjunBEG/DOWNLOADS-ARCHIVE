# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to ensure I complete my 6 daily habits I try to follow to live a [happy life](../life/happiness.md). The habits are chosen with great care and are a subset of my life [rules](rules.md) .

I get a notification every day at 21:00 on my phone to complete the habits.

## Habits described

`Cardio / Weights` autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app), [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com), [Fitbod](https://www.fitbod.me) or [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com) apps.

`Activity rings` autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is ~ 700 calories with fixed 50 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Healthy | Tea | Clean Skin` marked as done when I drank only water & tea. Limited coffee if any (get focus crushes). And ate only/primarily [nutritious whole foods (nuts/veggies/fruits)](../health/nutrition/foods.md) with focus on completing my [micro & macro nutrient goals](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md). I also [kept my skin clean](../health/skin-care.md) and washed/smelled well.

`Improve | Focus | Impactful` marked as done when I was not distracted by anything during the day (no analytics, wasting time). I worked on my [goals](goals.md) & used time wisely. I was calm, mindful and happy.

`Love | Create | Share` marked as done when all/most of my [values](../business/startups/values.md) and [rules](rules.md) were held well. I showed love to people I care about. I was nice. I made new things and shared it.

`Habits | Plan | Journal` marked as done when all the 6 habits here were complete. I made a plan for tomorrow and wrote things in my journal or somewhere. Writing helps me clear up my mind and clean up life and my thinking.

## New habits

I try learn new habits proactively by building systems and thought processes that lead me in [directions](../focusing/goals.md) I want to go. Everything is built around well defined [rules](../focusing/rules.md) & [processes](../focusing/processes.md).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
