# Cryptocurrencies

I think [Nano](nano.md) or [Solana](https://solana.com/) is the future of digital money if compared to any other coin based on features. Whilst [Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md) is great for building out more complex decentralized apps due to its [efficient working proof of stake consensus algorithm](https://tezos.gitlab.io/008/proof_of_stake.html).

It's a shame that [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) is still used to make [wasteful & slow transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0HC1Udk6-E) with its [horrible PoW consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

## Notes

- [The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods & providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error & latency will win.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)
