# Foods

I eat a whole food, plant based diet and experiment by trying out new [vegan recipes](recipes.md). I exclude all unhealthy food.

Most of my diet consists of eating raw foods like various nuts (almonds, walnuts), blueberries, bananas and avocados.

I try to cover my micro & macro nutrient needs by consuming nutritious food & [supplementing](supplements.md) where necessary. I sometimes make little smoothies.

I nearly always keep nuts & fruits at hand as they make for healthy quick snacks.

I use [Paprika app](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store recipes of foods I love eating. I love finding new recipes and foods through traveling.

My goto recipe is a simple omelette with tomatoes and Greek salad.

Here is a list of various plant based foods that I use to experiment and cook with. It helps to sometimes pick some ingredients and search recipes you can make with them.
