# Coffee

## Notes

- [Caffeine is a stimulant. The avg half life of caffeine in an adult is around 5h. So if you have a coffee at 5pm, it means that only 50% of it is gone by 10pm. Depending on how quickly you metabolise coffee, that half life could actually be up to 9h.](https://twitter.com/m_franceschetti/status/1378402354316328968)
