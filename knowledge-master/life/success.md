# Success

Success comes from not giving up and doing what you love.

## Notes

- Figure out what you are uniquely the best in the world at because you just love it. And then just find out who or what needs that the most.
- Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do. But it’s also the most competitive, which makes it the riskiest.
- If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.
- The trick with being confident, is accepting the results of an action or situation before it even happens.

- [All learning is dependent on feedback. The faster the feedback, the faster you can learn. Thus, in many domains, the individual, team, or organization with the fastest feedback cycle is the one that wins.](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1084862272734937095)
